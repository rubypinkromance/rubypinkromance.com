      &lt;p&gt;“Hey, Lauren.” Brad grinned at her from across the snack table. “Did I ever tell you I know hypnosis?” He was prone to outrageous claims like this. Once, he’d spent weeks trying to convince her that he was descended from royalty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I think I’d remember if you ever said something like that.” she winked playfully, pouring herself more eggnog. “See, I would have lost all respect for you, since hypnosis is bullshit.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lauren had been hiding in the break room, avoiding two groups of coworkers at the office holiday party. Karen was trying to gather people for a Christmas-themed trivia game, and Joey was drunkenly recruiting people to go caroling, of all things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brad didn’t know it, but his timing was perfect. He might be a bit of a dork, but bantering with him was far more entertaining than trivia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Hey, come on,” he protested, laughing off her good-natured ribbing. “I’m serious. I took a course and everything. Even got a certificate!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A certificate! Well, that changes everything. How much did that cost you?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Well,” he hesitated, picking up a cookie, “you can’t really put a price on a life-changing ability like this.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Ooh, it was a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt;, huh?” She sucked air between her teeth, playing it up. “That’s too bad, buddy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They paused for a moment as a few coworkers came in to grab drinks. One of them warned Lauren that Karen was looking for her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m telling you,” Brad said confidently after the others left, “this is the real deal.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“And I’m telling you, you got scammed.” She grinned and sipped her eggnog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Lauren,” he said with sudden seriousness. “I’ll bet you a hundred bucks I can hypnotize you.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She eyed him over the rim of her cup. He wasn’t kidding! She’d thought he was just goofing around, but maybe he really did get scammed? Now she actually felt a little bad for him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, a hundred bucks…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Come on,” he said, seeing her consider it. “What do you have to lose? You think hypnosis is bullshit, right? It should be easy money.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I dunno. How does this work? Are you gonna try to hypnotize me here in the break room? Make me think I’m a chicken or something?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“No, no, all this Christmas music is too distracting. We should go somewhere quieter. And don’t worry about the chicken thing, hypnosis can’t make you do anything you don’t want to do.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The approaching sound of drunken singing made up her mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Alright, quick, before Joey finds us. Let’s go to an empty office so I can win this bet, and you can contribute to my shoe fund.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few minutes later, having successfully evaded the carolers, Lauren shut the door behind her. The office had a nice view of the city, and a miniature Christmas tree with twinkling lights on the windowsill. Brad pulled out the desk chair for her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She sat down carefully, adjusting the hem of her dress, and tried not to smirk as Brad got into character. He rolled up his sleeves and produced a shiny copper coin hung from a chain. Standing seriously before her, he set the coin swinging like a pendulum. She played along, following it with her eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Now, I want you to focus on the coin. Watch it swing back and forth.” He spoke in a low voice, clearly reciting a memorized script. “Back and forth. You are becoming relaxed. Back and forth.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She didn’t feel any different. Maybe a little warm. A bit distracted by a raucous group of people coming down the hall. Something crashed, and they all laughed loudly. “Don’t worry about that noise,” he improvised. “Just focus on the coin.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lauren tried not to laugh. This was going to be the easiest money she’d ever made. She wondered how long he’d keep trying before admitting defeat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Whew, it’s warm in here,” he murmured, undoing a button on his shirt with one hand while continuing to swing the coin with the other. “Back and forth. You should be feeling very relaxed now.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She shifted uncomfortably in the chair. He was right, this office was quite warm. She slipped her cardigan off, hanging it over the back of the chair, trying to keep her eyes on the coin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Your focus is entirely on the coin. Back and forth. Relaxed. Calm.” He wiped his forehead nervously. “No thoughts, no concerns, no hesitations, just, um,” he trailed off as he fumbled with another shirt button. “Sorry, can you help me out? This is tricky with one hand.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rolling her eyes, she reached up to finish unbuttoning his shirt. He continued to swing the coin in front of her face. Did he really think this was working? She helped him pull his arm from one sleeve, then he moved the coin to his other hand, and let her pull the other sleeve off. Carelessly, he tossed his shirt onto the desk, standing before her in an undershirt. Without stopping the coin’s movement, he fanned himself with his other hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Back and forth. Your relaxation is growing with every passing moment. Back and forth.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She felt a trickle of sweat roll down her back and bit her lip in annoyance. Despite his continued intonation, she did not feel relaxed. She crossed, then uncrossed her legs. If he took much longer, she was going to sweat through her dress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m sorry, it’s so warm in here!” He grinned sheepishly. “It doesn’t, um, normally take this long. I’m sure the heat is making it hard to concentrate. Just try to focus on the coin.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was ridiculous. She wondered if he’d picked this office on purpose, to trick her into giving up and losing the bet. That wasn’t going to happen. He’d never let her hear the end of it. She had to stick it out. But if he took much longer, she was going to end up sweaty and disheveled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Hold on,” she said. “I can’t concentrate like this.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Oh? Are you ready to give up and admit I know hypnosis?” He asked eagerly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Not even,” she laughed as she stood up and turned partly away from him, trying to watch the coin over her shoulder. “Unzip me?” Sensing his hesitation, she rolled her eyes. “Don’t get any funny ideas. It’s just that if you take any longer, I’m going to sweat through everything, and this outfit is dry-clean only.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slowly, he unzipped her dress, which she slipped off with great relief. After laying it carefully over the back of the chair, she sat down again, wearing just her bra and thong. It was still too warm, but now she could focus on winning the bet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brad was staring. She crossed her arms and gave him a pointed look. He cleared his throat and tore his eyes from her chest, still swinging the coin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Sorry! Sorry. Um, back and forth. Back and forth.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He seemed so flustered, she almost felt bad. She resolved to play along and help him get his confidence back, so that later, he wouldn’t accuse her of distracting him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You are feeling very relaxed. Very calm. You are not bothered at all by how stupidly hot it is in this office.” He untucked his undershirt, and quickly flapped the hem, trying to fan himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She sighed and tried to keep her focus on the coin. It was like a sauna in here. She glanced at the window and briefly considered leaning against the cool glass for relief.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Back and forth…” He hesitated, wiping his forehead again. “Okay, I wouldn’t ask this, except you took your dress off, so, um, would it be okay if I did the same?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Seems only fair,” she conceded. “I suppose you need help again?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If that’s okay,” he said, kicking his shoes off. “If I stop swinging the coin, we’ll have to start over again.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She stood up to help pull his undershirt over his head, one arm at a time. He had a nice chest, she noted idly, resisting a sudden urge to run her hands over his torso. She blinked the thought away. Where did that come from?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He kept swinging the coin in front of her face as she sat down. Leaning forward, she unbuckled his belt and started lowering his slacks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Dude!” She jerked back at the unexpected sight of his cock swinging free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Shit!” He awkwardly attempted to tug his slacks back up with one hand. “Sorry! I forgot I came to the party commando.” He hesitated. “But, do I really have to put my pants back on? I mean, you’ve already seen it. And, seriously, it’s &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt; hot in here.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He continued swinging the coin as she frowned at him. Some part of her knew she should be upset. But he looked so awkward, she couldn’t bring herself to be mad. Plus, she had to admit he wasn’t bad to look at. Surprisingly hung. He kept trimmed and looked clean. It twitched hopefully as she regarded it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Whatever, forget about it,” she said, swatting his hand away, and letting his slacks fall to the floor. “It’s just a penis. Nothing to worry about.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Cool.” He stood confidently before her, swinging the coin. “Then, keep focusing. Back and forth. You are deeply relaxed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hypnosis was bullshit, but she had to admit, he’d finally managed to capture her full attention. She bit her lip. His cock was slowly swelling to life, lifting toward her, and swaying in time with the coin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Back and forth. God, it’s so hot in here,” he exclaimed again. “Are you sure you’re not too warm? I mean, now that I’m undressed, I feel way better. Wouldn’t you be more comfortable if you took your bra and underwear off? It seems silly for me to be naked, while you have to keep those on.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She was feeling flushed. Her bra itched, and she struggled to think of a reason to keep it on. He was already naked. She was nearly naked. And nothing inappropriate was going to happen, it was just practical to strip down in this heat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Fine,” she sighed. “I guess if you’ve already gone that far, there’s no reason for me to be uncomfortable.” She unhooked her bra and let it slip down her arms, feeling immediate relief. The air felt good on her bare skin. She exhaled in satisfaction and lay it on top of her dress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There you go,” he grinned as she stood up and pulled down her thong. “Feels better, huh? Now you can focus. That money is as good as yours.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That’s right!” She laughed and gave him a wink. “I told you hypnosis is bullshit. I don’t feel any different at all.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She didn’t feel hypnotized, but she was struggling to focus on the coin instead of his cock. It was now fully erect, and bobbed back and forth in time with the coin. She wondered how it would feel in her hand. To her surprise, she found herself starting to reach for him, and quickly grabbed the edge of the seat instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Are you sure about that?” He raised an eyebrow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Absolutely sure. I’m wide awake and in full control.” She resolved not to let him see how distracted she was. He’d try to claim it was the hypnosis, but it was only natural to want to look. How often did you get to see a coworker nude, let alone with their rather appealing erection swaying in front of your face? No one could blame her for being curious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Back and forth. You’re becoming entranced.” His voice dropped back into that practiced rhythm. “Back and forth.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She squeezed her legs together and tried to focus on the bet. If she proved him wrong, she’d get a hundred bucks to put towards those new shoes she wanted. All she had to do was concentrate, and stop getting distracted by the thought of running her tongue up his shaft like a popsicle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Follow the movement. Back and forth. You feel deeply relaxed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fuck, what was she doing? This was inappropriate! She shouldn’t be salivating over Brad’s dick like this. No matter how enticing it looked, or how good it would feel to touch…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You’re getting very aroused.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What?” She looked up at him, blushing furiously. “How did you… I mean, no I’m not!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You haven’t been watching the coin at all.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Well, I, just,” she gestured at his cock. “It’s distracting!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I can see that. Your nipples are hard.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That doesn’t mean anything!” She protested, resisting the suddenly overwhelming urge to squeeze her breasts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“And you’re squirming.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I am?” Shit. She hadn’t realized quite how obvious she was being. Now that she considered it, that familiar heat between her thighs had been building for some time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s okay,” Brad reassured her. “Obviously, I’m turned on, too. I’ve been trying not to take advantage of your hypnotized state, but, uh, it’s difficult when you lick your lips and lean closer like that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She hadn’t realized how far forward she was bending. With some effort, she forced herself to lean back in the chair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Look, forget about the coin,” he said, dropping it on the floor. “Hypnosis works with any focal point. And you’ve been fixated on my cock ever since we got undressed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What? No, dude. I didn’t get hypnotized by your dick. Don’t be ridiculous.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Hey, it’s perfectly natural! You wanted to win the bet so bad, you slipped into a state of hyper-focus.” His cock twitched. “And now you can’t stop staring.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I can stop!” She wrenched her eyes away, and triumphantly stuck her tongue out at him. “See? Just admit that you never hypnotized me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I can’t do that. You’re definitely in a trance. Look at you, with your tongue out, leaning forward again without realizing it. It’s obvious that you’re thinking about wrapping your lips around me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m not!” She absolutely was. She wanted to lick up that little bead of precum that had appeared at the tip. To swirl her tongue around his head, and swallow him. With some difficulty, she closed her mouth and pulled away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Do you even realize you’ve got a hand between your legs? Do you know how long you’ve been playing with yourself?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I didn’t,” she protested, “I wasn’t…” But it was true. Without even realizing she was doing it, her fingers had begun caressing her lips. She was sensitive, hungry for stimulation, and slick with excitement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Are you wet?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“No! I mean, fuck, yes,” she swore as she slipped a finger inside, “but this is stupid. Hypnosis is bullshit. I’m probably just ovulating, is all. I always get horny this time of the month, and you were swinging your cock in front of my face. Of course I got turned on! If we hadn’t picked such a warm office, and started undressing, nothing would have happened.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I have to tell you,” he said with some reluctance, “it’s not actually very warm in here. That was part of the hypnosis. I didn’t expect it to go this far.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That’s ridiculous. It’s like a sauna in here. The thermostat must be broken.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Lauren, I’m sorry that I’m such a gifted hypnotist.” He wrapped his hand around his shaft and started stroking. “I’m trying to do the right thing, but it’s hard with you touching yourself like that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Gifted, my ass,” she groaned, squeezing her breast. “You got swindled with a fake hypnosis class, and spent thirty minutes waving that stupid coin in front of me.” Unable to stop herself, she added another finger, curling inward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“How can you be so sure?” He gasped, flicking his thumb over his head. “Look at you spreading your legs so I can see you fingering yourself. You can’t help it. You got hypnotized by my cock, and now you’re uncontrollably aroused.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Nooo,” she protested, “I’m not! I just—Fuck, I’m so wet—It’s not hypnosis, it’s just dumb luck. Right place, right time. If it wasn’t you, I’d have gone home early, and I’d be rubbing one out in bed right now.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I don’t believe you,” he panted, stepping closer, masturbating directly in front of her face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I don’t care,” she moaned. “I just… Oh fuck, I just need…”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If you’re not hypnotized,” he shivered, feeling her hot breath on his skin, “then why are you opening your mouth for me?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Oh, shut up.” Her fingers worked urgently, wetness dripping from her knuckles. With her mouth open wide, she leaned forward, unable to stop herself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He groaned as she wrapped her lips around him as last. He was hot and firm, and she moaned as his cock throbbed on her tongue. The pressure in her core was building, squeezing around her fingers. He leaned forward, bracing himself on the back of the chair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Lauren,” he gasped in surprise as she angled her head to let him go deeper. “Oh fuck!” She braced her hand on his pelvis as he pushed eagerly into her throat. She struggled to relax her jaw, resisting the instinct to gag. “Fuck!” He thrust forward, unable to resist the urge to bury himself. She saw flares of color at the edge of her vision, and a warm gush around her fingers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, she pushed him away, choking as he pulled out. He staggered back against the wall, hand in a fist around the base of his cock. She sank back in the chair, gasping for breath. He stared, eyes wide, as she rubbed tight circles around her clit with one hand, still fingering herself with the other. She watched hungrily as he started slowly stroking the length of his shaft for her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I know that, uh,” he panted, struggling to control himself. “I know you want to win the bet. I know you think hypnosis is fake.” She shook her head, wanting him to stop talking. “But, come on. Just admit it! Admit that you’re absurdly turned on, and it’s because you were put in a trance by my cock.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Fuck me,” she groaned. “I’ve never seen a dude work so hard to avoid getting laid.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Laid?” His cock throbbed eagerly in his hand. “Lauren, look, I like you, and fucking hell do I want to go further, but you’re in a trance. It wouldn’t be right.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m not in a goddamn trance,” she growled. “I’m just horny, and I need a cock inside me, and you’re lucky enough to be here.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I don’t know,” he hesitated. “I don’t want to risk our friendship.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What’s risking our friendship is if you don’t bend me over this desk right now.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before he could answer, she got out of the chair and shoved everything on the desk to one side. Then she bent over the edge, and wiggled her ass at him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Oh fuck,” he mumbled, stepping up behind her. She shivered in anticipation as he rubbed the head of his cock between her lips. “Alright.” She laid her cheek on the cool surface and grabbed the far side of the desktop. They both moaned as he pushed inside, burying himself in one stroke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She felt deliriously good as he filled her. It was like letting out a breath she hadn’t realized she’d been holding. The entire time she’d been watching his cock sway back and forth in front of her eyes, her body had been preparing for this moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He grabbed her hips as he started sliding in and out. Every motion sent a ripple of sensation along her spine, leaving her gasping in time with his thrusts. He groaned as she squeezed around him, desperate for more. Her body was crackling with lust. She couldn’t believe how good this felt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abandoning any efforts at control, he began moving more urgently. She bit her knuckle to keep from loudly crying out with every thrust. The smaller items on the desk moved rhythmically, inching closer and closer to the edge. A cup of pens clattered loudly to the floor. A desk lamp fell, hanging by the cord, swaying in time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His cock seemed to swell, and she suddenly needed to shove a hand between her legs, clamping her fingers over her clit. Firm pressure helped to diffuse the nearly overwhelming sensation. She moaned, and reached lower, to brush against his shaft thrusting urgently into her. He was hard and hot and slick with her wetness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He groaned, feeling her touch, and started fucking her even harder. His fingers dug painfully into her hips, and she did cry out then. Her body shook, spasming with pleasure, squeezing around his girth. With a gush, she came, dripping down her thighs and onto the floor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Lauren,” he panted, “I’m close. Where should I cum?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her cunt clenched excitedly at the thought of letting him finish inside. She moaned happily, knowing that her climax was pushing him closer to the edge. Still holding her clit with one hand, she lifted onto her other elbow to look back at him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Cum inside me,” she moaned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Oh fuck,” he gasped, eyes wide with surprise. “Are you sure—ah!—you don’t want me to cum on your tits?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Stop trying to prove you hypnotized me! I know what I want!” She rubbed her clit, building rapidly towards another orgasm. “Now, pull my hair and fucking cum in me!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He reached forward, grabbed her hair in one hand, and pulled gently back, grunting with each thrust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Harder!” She groaned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He tightened his grip, jerking her head back. Her mouth hung open, panting as he fucked her over the desk. Waves of pleasure radiated from her core, rippling around his cock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Cumming!” He blurted, as he slammed into her one last time, burying himself deep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Fuck! Yes!” She shuddered as she felt him twitching. “Oh my god!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He let go of her hair and leaned against her, making a little surprised sound each time he throbbed inside her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She moaned happily, finally feeling completely relaxed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After some time, he softened and slipped out. She covered her lips with her fingers, trying to keep his cum from leaking all over the floor. The pressure felt good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He stumbled back and collapsed into the desk chair, trying to catch his breath.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She turned around, leaning on the desk with one hand between her legs, and smiled crookedly at him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Fucking hell, Brad, that was something.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He laughed breathlessly and gave her a thumbs-up in agreement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still tingling with aftershocks of pleasure, she picked up a fallen box of tissues and started wiping up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Lauren,” he said, climbing to his feet, “that was incredible.” She nodded in agreement. “But seriously, I shouldn’t have let that get out of hand…”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Are you still worried about the bet?” She laughed incredulously. “You lost, man! Your hypnosis didn’t do anything, just like I knew it wouldn’t.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“No, seriously, I don’t think you…”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Brad, forget it.” She stepped into her underwear. “Did you have a good time?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Well, yeah, but…” He watched her fasten her bra with concern in his eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“So did I. I’ll make you a deal.” She pulled up her dress and turned around so he could zip her up. “Keep your money, but take me out to dinner soon.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He nodded as she gave him a kiss on the cheek.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“And no more hypnosis talk, alright? It was a decent pickup line, but you can consider me ‘captivated’ already.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She walked out feeling quite pleased with herself, leaving him looking awestruck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hypnosis! Ridiculous.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A hot new book from Ruby Pink!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Coat Check Room&lt;/em&gt; brings you three steamy short stories from author Ruby Pink exploring domination and submission. “The Queen of Marketing” acts out a longtime fantasy by dominating the insufferable head of another department. In “Shower Surprise,” a man is caught in an indiscreet moment by his impatient coworker when he forgets to lock the door to the office shower room. And in the titular “Coat Check Room,” a coat check girl takes great delight in telling her companion about her journey into the world of submissiveness, teasing him mercilessly, until his boss catches them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ruby Pink loves reading erotica but was frustrated to find so many featuring shallow women with no agency. She took up the pen to bring us steamy shorts about real women who aren’t just props in male fantasies.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;“Stop moving!” The artist grumbled at us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I resisted the urge to squirm as my companion’s erection pressed into my thigh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We stood together, nude, bound together by a strip of gauzy fabric around our legs. Bright sunlight illuminated our pedestal in the middle of the studio. The artist peered at us from behind his easel, pallet in hand. Paintings that would have sold for more than my rent leaned carelessly against the wall. The smell of strong coffee almost covered up the lingering aroma of turpentine, and tinny music played from a cheap stereo in the corner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, I wasn’t really paying attention to the studio. It no longer held any mysteries for me. I had spent many long hours there, holding poses until my muscles ached, with nothing to do but stare at my surroundings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most painters only hire a model for an hour or two, and take reference photos. It’s easier, but pays a lot less. This artist was unusual in his approach. Old-school. He believed there was value in painting from a live model, which meant long sessions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My companion and I were two of the only models who were up for it, which is why so many paintings on the walls depicted our bodies. The curve of my hips. His broad shoulders. The swell of my breasts. His muscular thighs. My rosy nipples. His uncircumcised cock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’d never actually worked together before this, but when I walked in, our eyes met in a crackle of recognition. He paused in the middle of taking off his shoes, and I knew right away that he’d spent just as long staring at the paintings of my body as I’d spent admiring his. He arched his eyebrows, raised a hand in greeting, and pulled his shirt over his head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I quickly retreated behind the folding screen. I’d always found the screen silly. After all, if I was about to pose nude, why provide privacy for the undressing? But this time, I was grateful for it. I hung up my dress and tucked my underwear into my bag, hoping the blush would fade from my cheeks by the time I walked out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The artist bustled around us impatiently, and we fell into the usual routine of negotiating the pose, trying to balance what he wanted with what we could hold comfortably. In the end, we found ourselves facing each other, my hands on his chest, his on my hips. The artist wrapped a thin sheet of gauzy fabric tightly around our legs, giving him some texture and color to contrast against our skin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We rested our heads together, with him gazing down at me, as if we’d just kissed. The artist fussed about our height difference, and I found myself up on my tiptoes, leaning against my companion for balance. My breasts pressed against his chest. We pretended not to notice the way our pelvises were making contact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Satisfied, the artist retreated to his canvas to sketch and mix colors. I felt an odd blend of awkwardness and intimacy, pressed against his body like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Hey,” he said under his breath. “Nice to finally meet you.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You too,” I replied. “I’m Claire.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Ben,” he said, “but everyone calls me Tex.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You don’t sound like you’re from Texas.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m not,” he conceded, “but you wear cowboy boots to work one time…”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I snorted. The artist looked up and frowned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Don’t make me laugh,” I whispered. “You’re gonna get us in trouble!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Sorry,” he said, trying not to grin. “I’m just nervous. I’ve seen so many paintings of you, it’s like meeting a celebrity.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Really?” I tried to play it cool. “What’s your favorite?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The one by the door, with the red background.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Oh?” I risked a quick look over my shoulder. In the painting, I held a hand dramatically to my head, as if about to swoon. A swatch of fabric was draped carelessly over my shoulder, leaving one breast exposed. “Yeah, I remember posing for that one. The studio was freezing, even with that noisy space heater going.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“How about you?” He asked with studied casualness. “Any of mine ever catch your eye?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Hmm.” I pretended to consider the options. In truth, I already knew the answer. “I like the one by the window where you’re sprawled across the couch.” I’d spent hours admiring it. He had an arm over his eyes. One foot propped on the arm of the couch, the other resting on the floor. My eye was always drawn to his cock, prominent, but not yet erect. More than once, I’d imagined kneeling next to him, taking him in hand, and feeling him swell to life for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Oh, yeah,” Ben chuckled. “He told me to imagine I’d just had sex, and was lying there, breathless, after a climax.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“He did not!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Well,” he grinned, “maybe that was just what I imagined.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Stop talking!” The artist snapped. “I can’t get the line of your jaw if you’re chatting.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We fell silent, but all I could think of was his post-coital sprawl on the couch. I wanted to ask him more. Sometimes during a long pose, my imagination would run wild. How elaborate a fantasy had he constructed of this sexual encounter? Was she on top? Did he cum inside her?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did she look like me?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His chest rose and fell against mine. I felt a flutter in my core. His hands were on my hips, and it was a struggle not to imagine them sliding downward. &lt;em&gt;Don’t&lt;/em&gt;, I scolded myself. &lt;em&gt;Be professional.&lt;/em&gt; This was a dangerous train of thought. We could be here for hours yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way the artist had positioned us meant his head was angled down, as if gazing lovingly at me, about to pull me into a kiss. I looked up, resisting the sudden urge to press my lips to his. Could he see the spark of desire in my eyes? He glanced away, but unable to move his head, he found himself looking at my breasts pressed against his chest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I shivered, and my nipples stiffened involuntarily. I bit my tongue in frustration at my body’s automatic response to his proximity. His eyes widened, and he averted his gaze as best he could. I felt a rush of gratitude for him not taking advantage of the situation, undercut by a confusingly contradictory annoyance that he wasn’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was becoming perversely clear that the very act of resisting my growing arousal was only intensifying things. My heart pounded and I struggled not to squirm. If this continued, the heat radiating from between my thighs would be impossible for him to ignore. I stared into his eyes, desperately praying that he couldn’t tell how badly I was losing this battle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I squeezed my legs together, as discreetly as I could, desperate for some relief. Had I ever become this turned on, this fast? I felt ridiculous, but I also wanted more. Rationally, I knew it was about the situation, more than anything. It was intoxicating, being so close, and unable to move away from this man I’d spent hours fantasizing about. His skin, his scent, his lips, his eyes. I was drowning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abruptly, I became aware of a growing pressure against my inner thigh. I inhaled in surprise, and saw the alarm in his eyes. Oh! I’d been worried that he would see my barely controlled lust as unprofessional, but he’d been just as busy suppressing his body’s reaction to me!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His cock throbbed, straining and swelling larger. I shivered as a matching wave of desire rolled down my spine. His hands tightened on my hips, unsure of my reaction, not knowing whether to push me away or pull me more tightly against him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He parted his lips as if to say something, but I lightly dug my fingernails into his chest to stop him. I risked a glance at the artist. His attention was mostly on the canvas, brush in hand, looking our way now and then. I licked my lips, and risked rocking my pelvis forward, increasing the pressure between us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He stiffened in surprise, but I felt his cock twitch, trapped between us. I wanted more. I wanted to grind against him. For him to dig his fingers into my hips, then reach down, grab my ass and lift me up, until I wrapped my thighs around him. My insides clenched at the thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I gazed up at him, trying to communicate without words that I was just as turned on as he was, that he had nothing to worry about. Just moments ago, I’d been worried that my arousal was too obvious for him to ignore, and now I feared it was too subtle. I needed him to know. What could we do? I considered asking the artist if we could take a break, but it hadn’t been long enough. Besides, what was I going to do? Pull him down the hall for a quick fuck in the stairwell?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Immediately, it was all I could think about. The feel of rough concrete against my back, thighs wrapped around him as he thrust passionately into me. I wanted to dig my nails into his back, bite his neck to keep from screaming as he fucked me senseless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without thinking about it, I rocked my hips against him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Stop moving!” The artist muttered again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I resisted the urge to squirm as Ben’s erection pressed into my thigh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His eyes seemed to plead with me, praying that I would find a way to help. I wanted to move, to drag my aching nipples across his chest. His cock throbbed with every heartbeat, pinned between us, straining to spring upward. I licked my lips, struggling not to raise my mouth to meet his.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as I was about to give up and say we needed to a break, the artist stood, stretched, and turned his back on us to refill his coffee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Claire,” Ben breathed, “what do we do?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Shh,” I hushed him. We only had a moment. My heart was pounding. We had to make this count. Nothing could look different when the artist turned around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The movement I made was neither graceful nor dignified. Awkwardly, due to the fabric wrapped tightly around our legs, I shimmied, rolling my hips and parting my thighs to guide his cock between them. Ben gasped as his shaft practically slapped against my lips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just in time, I resumed my original position as the artist sat down at his easel and returned his attention to us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suppressed a shiver at the new sensation. Ben’s cock was now nestled between my thighs, pressed directly against me. He was so close, I could feel his heartbeat. Every time he twitched and strained, it sent a wave of stimulation through my body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Painstakingly slowly, I started to move in microscopic amounts. Fractionally clenching my buttocks, and rocking my hips in ways I prayed were invisible to the artist. Ben’s cock was hard as steel, and every little motion rubbed us together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He gazed at me, awestruck and struggling to control his breathing. When he licked his lips, I felt a crackle of lust dance down my spine. I savored the way our bodies pressed together as I leaned against him, grateful that the pose the artist had chosen brought us together like this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He tensed, and I felt his cock throb against me. My insides clenched, and something changed, a small gush of release. I barely choked back a small moan. His eyes widened in surprise as he felt my growing wetness. I continued to work slowly back and forth, my lips parting and sliding easily along his shaft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I stared into his eyes, savoring the barely controlled lust I saw there. He strained upward, and suddenly, his bulbous head was pressed against my entrance. He dug his fingers into my hips, struggling to maintain control. My entire body burned with need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He looked at me with desperation. &lt;em&gt;Please&lt;/em&gt;, I could almost hear him begging me for permission. &lt;em&gt;Please let me do it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I moved my head fractionally, the slightest hint of a nod.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slowly, slowly, slowly, he slipped inside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Ohhh,” I exhaled, biting my lip to refrain from moaning his name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I dared another quick look at the artist, who seemed absorbed in his brushwork, glancing between us and the canvas. Could he really be unaware that Ben’s cock was entering me?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I continued my slow-motion dance, leaning against him on my tiptoes. I willed my body to draw him further in, alternately squeezing and relaxing. His entire body was tense, while trying not to be too obviously straining.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He kept his eyes locked on mine, holding my gaze, though all of our attention was focused on his cock slowly filling my pussy. Maintaining that pose was the most difficult thing I’ve ever done. All I wanted was to kiss him, to throw my arms around his neck. I wanted his hands on my ass. I wanted him to throw me down on the ground and thrust forcefully into me over and over and over…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How long had he been pushing into me? It felt like hours, endlessly teasing deeper and deeper. The sensation intensified with every passing second, until it felt like I was going to either scream or pass out. My heartbeat pounded in my ears as I continued to bloom around his girth, blossoming like a flower in the morning sunlight. I ached for the moment I would finally feel my lips wrapped around the base of his shaft, to know he was buried completely inside me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some part of me was still vaguely aware of the artist, the sound of his brush on canvas, humming quietly the way he did when he got into a groove. I suddenly realized that I couldn’t wait to see the painting. Would he capture the heat? The tension as we tried desperately not to reveal our secret? The hunger in our eyes? I imagined colorful waves of lust radiating from us, like a psychedelic album cover.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thought slipped away as Ben, at last, filled me completely. His cock twitched, stimulating secret places deep inside, and I suppressed a groan. I bit my lip and savored the sensation. I swear I could feel every ridge, every vein, every pulse of his heartbeat. I’ve never been so aware of a lover’s body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was breathing heavily through gritted teeth, trying desperately not to make any noise. I struggled against the urge to move, to rock, to grind. All I could do was squeeze and clench around him. He was astonishingly hard, straining and throbbing in my welcoming heat. Through half-lidded eyes, I saw his face through a rosy haze.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted him so badly. God, I wanted to fuck him. I wished he would lift me up, thrusting frantically as I pulled his head to my breast, letting him suck hard on my nipples, until I screamed. Let the artist paint that! The moment of climax, lips and fingers and breasts and cock and pussy and fuck fuck fuck…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My body tensed, pressure building and building. He seemed to sense it was coming, watching me with wide eyes as his cock swelled in my grasping passage. It was all I could do to hold the pose…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Ben,” I gasped, unable to stop myself as an orgasm washed over me in a sudden flood. All the tension drained away as my insides clenched rhythmically around him. Grasping endlessly at his unyielding firmness, trying to pull him even deeper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as I started to come back into myself, he made a quiet sound, and his cock started twitching. I barely managed not to moan at the spreading warmth inside. His eyes glazed, unaware of anything beyond the sensation of cumming in my still-clenching pussy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I stared, awestruck, as he continued to hold the pose even as his climax spilled into me. I savored the feeling of his pulsing shaft nestled between my walls. A sense of deep relaxation and relief flooded my brain. I wanted to stay here forever, with him inside me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We gazed into each other’s eyes, astonished. Even if we’d been able to speak, I’m not sure that I could have said anything coherent. We’d just met, but now we had this breathtaking secret. And the whole time, an artist had been capturing the moment when we fucked without moving, cumming as one, and still somehow holding our pose. I couldn’t tell if I wanted to collapse or laugh deliriously or shout in triumph.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I shivered as his cock shifted inside me, starting to soften. His breathing was less strained, and now that the moment of passion was fading, I was unable to read his expression. I resisted the urge to squeeze tightly, to hold him in place, and prolong the moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How did he feel? What would happen when the session ended? Would he get dressed and leave without saying a word? Would he ask me out? Did I want him to? How could any other experience possibly live up to this one? Maybe it would be better to just go our separate ways, keeping this one perfect moment?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He continued to hold me, gazing into my eyes, but the connection seemed to have evaporated. Our pose was meant to express longing, tenderness, and desire. I thought I’d seen all of those in him, but now that he’d cum, I worried it was all in my head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And frustratingly, my body was still crackling with lust. Every time his cock twitched, I knew we were closer to the moment when he would fully slip out of me. I wanted more! I wanted him to keep going, keep filling me, keep holding me until I came around him again and again. The thought that I’d have to continue standing here, waiting out the rest of the session with his cum drying on my thighs, desperate for more, made me want to cry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The artist leaned back and stretched, clattering his brushes in a way that I recognized. Any moment now, he’d ask if we needed a break.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ben heard the same thing, and his eyes widened with concern. Probably worried about how to untangle himself from me without making it incredibly obvious what we’d done. Or trying to figure out how to suggest a new pose, one where we weren’t touching anymore. My body screamed in frustration, clenching involuntarily around him…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“How are you two doing? Need a break?” The artist asked casually, unaware of my inner turmoil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Um,” Ben hesitated, still looking into my eyes. “I’m good. I’d, uh, I’d like to keep going. You know, if that’s okay with Claire?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Ahh!” I couldn’t help gasping in surprise as his cock throbbed repeatedly inside me, as if sending me a message. I struggled not to moan in animal satisfaction. “Yes! I mean, uh, yeah, that’s cool. I want more, I mean, I’m okay with doing more. Of this, um, pose.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ben grinned with obvious relief.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Well, alright, then.” The artist nodded. “Let’s keep going. Try not to move.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’ll do my best,” I purred, already starting the dance again.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;“Jax, my man!” Gio looked up from assembling a pizza as I walked in the back door. “What are you doing here? I thought Omar was driving tonight?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“He asked me to cover his shift,” I replied. “Said he caught something from his roommate.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Alright, well, I’ve got an order about ready to go.” He held up the receipt. “Looks like you’re heading to the Pearl district.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Ugh, I hate parking over there,” I frowned. “Wait, what’s the name on the order?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Uh… Murray? Looks like they’re a regular. Same order every week, like clockwork. Why, you know them or something?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Nah, but get a load of this. After I said I’d cover his shift, Omar got all serious. Said if I get a delivery in the Pearl for Murray, don’t go in, even if they invite me. He was real insistent.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Murray sounds like a stoner’s name.” Gio chuckled as he pulled the pizza from the oven, dropping it in a box and quickly slicing it. “Dude probably invited him in once and talked his ear off.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Knowing Omar,” I grinned, “more likely it’s some lonely housewife.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Ha!” He lapsed into a low-budget porn star impression. “Oh no, mister! I don’t have any money, but maybe I can pay you some other way?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Fingers crossed, man,” I laughed, slipping the box into a hot bag and walking out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Behind the strip mall was a small parking lot. It exited to the street on one side, and on the other was a narrow alley between two buildings. The moon was hidden behind a heavy layer of clouds, and the parking lot light flickered out as I walked to my car, plunging me into darkness. Cursing, I pulled out my phone to turn on the flashlight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I did, a car turned down the side street, and its headlights briefly sliced through the parking lot. For just a second, I thought I saw a thin, pale figure in the alley. Probably a bum, I figured, as I unlocked the car and dropped the pizza on the passenger seat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The engine struggled to start, complaining and straining. “Come on,” I grumbled. I’d just spent my last paycheck at the mechanic, and they swore they’d fixed the starter. For a second, the motor turned over, then sputtered and died. Before it did, the headlights caught that person in the alley again, closer than before. It looked like a woman, with short dark hair, staring right at me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I peered over the dash, but there wasn’t enough light to see down the alley. Shrugging, I tried the key again, and this time the engine started. The headlights flooded the parking lot and alley with light, and there was no one there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The drive to the Pearl was boring, but I kept seeing some big fucking bat flying overhead. I’ve never seen bats in the city before. Plenty of rats and pigeons, but never bats. They look weird as shit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I finally found a place to park just a few blocks from the delivery address, so I felt pretty lucky when I started walking. This part of town is full of fancy bars and restaurants, so I was walking past lots of people having a fun night out. The address turned out to be an upscale apartment building. I buzzed their number, and a lady’s voice answered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Thirteenth floor, come on up,” she said, buzzing me in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the lobby was a wall of mailboxes, a doorway to the stairs, and an elevator. I pushed the button and waited, then I got that creeping sensation on the back of my neck, like someone was looking at me. I turned around, expecting to see someone looking in the window, but almost jumped out of my skin because there was someone standing right behind me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Sorry!” She apologized, holding up her keys. “Didn’t mean to scare you. I came in behind you. Guess you didn’t hear me?” She had pale skin, short-cropped black hair, and dark eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Uh, yeah,” I laughed nervously. “I guess not.” I was sure no one had come in after me. I hadn’t heard the door or anything, and I would have noticed if she slipped in behind me. Weird.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She smiled and rocked on her heels, looking at the floor readout above the elevator. I shook my head, trying to shake off an odd feeling that she was the woman I saw in the alley. But, no, that was just my mind playing tricks on me. There wasn’t anyone in the alley, remember? Besides, that was across town.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the elevator finally arrived, I stepped in and pressed the button for the thirteenth floor. She followed me in, standing in the back. I looked at her, waiting to hear what button to push. “Same floor,” she remarked. Her grin seemed strangely ominous, and I tried not to shiver as I turned my back on her. Although I couldn’t see her reflection in the buffed metal walls of the elevator, I could feel her eyes on the back of my neck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I left the elevator quickly, telling myself I wasn’t afraid or anything, I was just trying to deliver the pizza before it got cold. Her footsteps seemed to follow me down the hall. This was ridiculous. I couldn’t be afraid of some random woman who lived here. I took a deep breath as I approached the door and knocked, wondering who would answer that Omar had felt the need to warn me about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had to suppress a grin when a voluptuous woman in a silk robe opened the door. Her hair was dyed pink, with her nails painted to match. She smiled seductively and stepped aside, swinging the door wide, inviting me in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Oh, I, um, I’m just here with your pizza,” I stammered. Gio was never gonna believe this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I could form a more coherent response, the woman from the elevator stepped around me into the apartment. She kissed the robed woman on the lips and sauntered in, kicking off her shoes and removing her jacket. My cheeks burned from how badly I’d misread the situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fucking Omar, I laughed to myself. He made such a big deal of not going in, and then it turned out to just be a couple of lesbians! He must have known I’d jump to the wrong conclusion. I should have known better, this is totally the kind of prank he likes to pull. I’d have to get him back good for this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Come on in,” she said, patting her robe theatrically to show she had no pockets. “My purse is in the kitchen.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I stepped in, looking around as she shut the door behind me. The apartment was pretty nice, though all their furniture was old stuff. Probably instagram types, I thought, posting videos about restoring antiques and shit. She led me through to the kitchen, where I put the pizza on the island as she picked up her purse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Eve, I’m putting on some music,” called the dark-haired woman from the next room. “What do you want?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Portishead,” she called back, before asking me with a smile, “Where’s Omar?” There was a twinkle in her eyes that made me wonder if she was in on the joke. “He’s our usual delivery guy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Sick,” I nodded. “He called me to cover his shift.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Hmm. Are you new? I don’t think I’ve seen you before.” She licked her lips. “I’m sure I’d remember if I had.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No mistaking that. She was definitely flirting. I shot a nervous glance toward the other room, where the dark-haired woman was standing by the stereo. Slow, throbbing bass rumbled from a large set of speakers, and she started swaying in place, eyes closed, vibing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I, uh, normally work the day shift.” I turned back to the robed woman, who was leaning on the other side of the island, rummaging through her purse. Her robe hung open just enough to tease the curve of her breasts. I swallowed, and tried to look away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Well, that explains it. Mina and I are night owls.” She chuckled, as though she’d said something funny, and pushed her purse away. “What’s your name?” Her fingernails absent-mindedly trailed down the lapel of her robe, drawing my attention to the way her nipples raised the thin fabric.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Jackson,” I mumbled, tearing my eyes away with some difficulty. “I’m Jackson.” She bit her lip and slowly walked around the island toward me. Her robe was coming loose. My heart was pounding in my chest. “Um, is it hot in here?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I took a step backward and yelped when I bumped into Mina, who was suddenly standing behind me. “Seems fine to me,” she growled in my ear. I tried to move away, but she put a hand on my shoulder, and I felt compelled to stay where I was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What do you think, Mina?” Eve purred as she sauntered closer. I caught a glimpse of her thigh as her robe parted. Her skin was darker than Mina’s, a rich copper, gleaming as if she’d recently rubbed herself down with oil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“He’s not our usual order,” Mina grumbled, pressing her face to my neck and inhaling deeply, as if trying to decide if she liked me based on how I smelled. My pulse was pounding in my ears. I felt sudden relief that I had showered before work. “What happened to Omar?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They’re all out. Tonight, we got &lt;em&gt;Jackson&lt;/em&gt;,” Eve replied, emphasizing my name. “Seems a waste to send him back.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Hrm,” Mina conceded, grabbing a handful of my hair and pulling my head back to expose more of my neck. I shivered as I felt her lips brush against my skin. They were chilled, as though she’d just come in from the cold, though it was a warm night. “You &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; always telling me to try new things.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That’s the spirit.” Eve ran her hands over my chest, and I couldn’t help but gasp as I felt a powerful surge of lust. Confusingly, it was mixed with a sense of dread. She leaned into me, and the heat of her body made me want to tear off our clothes, to feel her skin on mine. Her breasts were soft against my chest, and I felt my cock swelling to life against her hip. She moved as if to kiss me, but at the last second swerved to kiss Mina over my shoulder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I shivered, sandwiched between these two women, completely overwhelmed. It was all happening so quickly. My mind swirled with a fantasy of falling into bed with them, writhing and groping, thrusting and moaning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But also, some primal part of my brain was screaming that I was in danger. As badly as I wanted to stay here and let them have their way with me, I was struggling not to turn and run as far and fast as I could.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As if sensing my fear, Mina’s hand tightened on my shoulder as they broke their kiss. The music grew louder, the throbbing bass filling my brain and drowning out any thought of resisting. Eve pulled away, dancing sensuously for the two of us. Her robe fell open, and my cock strained against my jeans at the sight of her body. Large, dark nipples crowned her breasts, firm and erect, begging for my mouth. A trail of fine hair led my eyes downward from her belly button.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Look at her,” Mina groaned in my ear. “Isn’t she incredible?” I realized that Eve’s dance was affecting Mina the same as me. She released my shoulder and wrapped her arms around me, her pelvis grinding against me from behind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You have no idea how lucky you are, Jackson. Men have offered fortunes for the privilege of seeing Eve dance.” Abruptly, she grabbed my cock, nails sharp even through my jeans, and I stifled a cry of alarm. “Men have &lt;em&gt;died&lt;/em&gt; for a single night of ecstasy between her thighs.” She eased her grip, teasing her fingers along the length of my shaft. “What will you give up, I wonder?” I shuddered, eyes locked on Eve, barely resisting the urge to hump against her hand like a horny teenager.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Come dance with me,” Eve said, moving toward the living room, slipping out of her robe as she went. When Mina released me, I trailed after Eve, unaware of anything beyond the sway of her hips, the swell of her bottom. Without thinking, I began to remove my clothes, leaving them in a trail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We came together in front of the speakers, moving as one. I’ve never been a particularly good dancer, but she guided me. Our bodies entwined, a delicious thrill as the heat of her body met mine. Her soft curves undulated at my touch. My cock throbbed, hard as steel, rubbing against her well-oiled skin. Every touch sent a shiver of pleasure through my body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our lips met in a kiss that seemed to be part of her dance. I held her breasts and gasped as she sucked on my bottom lip. Her hands roamed my body, showing me how to move with her. I felt as if she was speaking a language I’d never learned, but as long as she was here, I could almost understand it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unable to resist, I lowered my head and wrapped my lips around her nipple. She moaned and rolled her hips, tangling her fingers in my hair, without ever stopping the dance. She guided me to her other breast, gasping as I flicked my tongue. My cock throbbed against her soft skin, and I almost choked with arousal as I kissed my way down her chest and stomach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found myself on my knees, worshipping her. She moved in circles around me, and I leaned after her, trying to get closer. I yearned for more, but she stayed just out of reach, driving me wild, teasing me, and stoking my hunger for her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When she finally stepped closer and allowed me to bury my face between her thighs, I felt a ripple of gratification roll down my spine. She’d judged me worthy and graced me with a taste of paradise. My tongue slipped easily between her lips, slick with arousal. She rolled her hips in time to the music, letting me lick deeper each time. Her taste filled my mouth, the flavor of pure lust, better than anything I’d ever experienced. I moaned happily, body crackling with desire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I became aware that Mina was standing behind me. She was leaning over me to kiss Eve deeply. Her skin was cold against my back, though perhaps that was just in contrast to the astonishing heat of Eve’s body. I could hear the passion of their kiss as Eve danced against my mouth. I could have stayed there all night, but suddenly Mina grabbed me by the hair and pulled me away with a snarl.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I sputtered in protest as she forced me to turn around, still on my knees. She had also removed her clothes, and her skin was shockingly pale compared to Eve’s. Her breasts were smaller, with pale nipples puckered to hard little points. She spread her thighs, revealing a startlingly pink set of lips that she yanked me towards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She shivered as my lips met hers, still covered in Eve’s juices, as if using me to transfer her arousal. Even her pussy was cold. I licked deeply, trying to warm her up, to pleasure her as I’d done for Eve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mina used me more forcefully, tugging my hair hard, positioning me the way she wanted. She bucked her hips, grinding herself against my face, using me for pleasure. For a moment, doubt filled my head, the haze of lust falling away, replaced by fear. What was I doing?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I felt Eve’s hand on my back, and my concerns melted away, replaced by a warm wave of desire. Mina moaned as I sucked on her firm little clit, and slipped a finger inside. Eve’s legs were hot against my back as she leaned forward to wrap her lips around Mina’s nipples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mina gasped and tensed as we both focused our efforts on her. She rocked against my face, gripping my hair. “More,” she growled. I slipped another finger inside, her pussy squeezing wetly around them. “More,” she repeated. Eve purred, swaying in time to the music, pulling more of Mina’s small breast into the heat of her mouth. “Oh fuck, more!” She tugged my hair harder until I tapped another finger on her back door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“More, more, more,” she demanded. I pushed my finger harder against her tightly clenched ass, slowly working it inside. She groaned, and I felt her squeeze my fingers, wetness dripping down my arm. Urgently, I started fucking her in time with Eve’s movements. Mina groaned with each thrust, and Eve moaned along with her, seeming just as aroused.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That’s it,” she growled as her body tensed. “Keep doing that.” My cock throbbed desperately. I had the taste of two women in my mouth. I wondered if she would let me fuck her if I made her cum. How would it feel to push my cock inside her? I imagined switching back and forth between Mina’s tight pussy and Eve’s soft cunt, savoring the contrast between them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Fuck!” Mina snarled. “Fuck! I’m cumming!” With one final thrust against my mouth, her insides clenched so tightly around my fingers it almost hurt. Then she shoved me away, forcefully, shuddering as my fingers slipped out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I fell hard onto my back, grateful for the thick rug as my head bounced off the floor. Before I had a chance to say anything, Eve kneeled and kissed me deeply, licking Mina’s cum from my lips. I gasped at the absurd rush of lust I felt when her lips touched me. If I didn’t know better, I’d swear her touch was getting me high.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unable to resist, I wrapped my hand around my shaft and started stroking, moaning into Eve’s mouth. She purred happily and broke our kiss to watch, squeezing her breast and pulling her nipple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Please,” I gasped, looking up at her. I wanted so badly to fuck her. She winked and gestured for me to look down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did, and a cold wave of panic crashed over me. Crouched over my legs was Mina, but something was different about her. She looked predatory, licking her lips and panting hungrily. I let go of my cock and started trying to scrabble away from her, but bumped into Eve’s legs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I warned you,” Mina said with a cruel smile. “What will you give up? No one gets to dance with my wife for free, mortal.” Her teeth suddenly looked very sharp. “And I’m so hungry.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Oh fuck!” I practically sobbed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Shh,” Eve reassured me, gently caressing my chest. “Be still.” The stimulation made me shiver, and my cock twitched, but my brain was still flooded with terror.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mina crawled forward, staring hungrily as my cock throbbed in time with my heartbeat. She opened her mouth and moved closer, brushing her lips over the tip and lightly dragging her teeth down the shaft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I moaned in horror as Eve continued to caress me and whisper soothingly. “Relax,” she breathed. “You made her cum, she’s in a good mood.” Mina’s eyes flashed dangerously. She didn’t look like she was in a good mood. She looked like she wanted to devour me. “I promise, she won’t drain you completely. &lt;em&gt;Will you&lt;/em&gt;, Mina?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mina hissed, but nodded in grudging agreement. “Fine, my love. For you, I’ll restrain myself.” Then she licked her lips, and I watched in horror as she opened her mouth to reveal two long, pointed teeth, which she promptly plunged into the side of my cock. Blood flowed freely for a moment before she wrapped her lips tightly around me, swallowing hungrily. I cried out, more from shock than pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Not as bad as you thought, is it?” Eve murmured quietly in my ear. I nodded, my fear quickly melting away, replaced by a strange new form of arousal. “Vampire saliva is an incredibly potent aphrodisiac, almost as strong as anything I secrete.” My head was swimming, and I was barely able to understand her words. “Like, everyone knows a succubus will get you off, the best sex you ever had. And it’s true,” she said proudly. “But a vampire can, too. It’s an evolutionary trait…”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She kept talking, but all my attention was on Mina. Her eyes were rolled back in pleasure, slurping greedily as my life flowed into her mouth. I found myself unbelievably turned on by the sight. Rationally, I knew I should be terrified, but instead my cock throbbed and pulsed for her. I gasped and reached down to touch her head, but she snarled at me, eyes flashing red.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I wouldn’t do that,” Eve giggled. “Here, you can touch me.” She swung her breasts over my head, and I moaned gratefully, squeezing and burying my face between them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Incredibly, I felt a familiar pressure building. Mina’s lips sucked urgently, tongue lashing against my skin. Eve’s breasts rubbed against my face, her skin hot and slick with sweat that seemed to soak into my pores, making my nerves buzz with arousal. I groaned desperately, knowing that any second my cock would erupt, spraying hot cum over Mina’s face. I wanted to, so badly, but I had a feeling that might go poorly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Eve,” I begged into her cleavage. “I need to cum!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Mmm, give it to me,” she purred, and quickly crawled down my side to wrap her lips around my swollen head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Oh fuck!” I gasped, staring at the incredibly erotic sight of two women sucking my cock. Mina stared up at me through half-lidded eyes, still swallowing hungrily, and Eve met my gaze with an excited look. I felt my cock swell on her tongue as my climax crashed over me. “I’m cumming,” I blurted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eve moaned happily as I came hard, flooding her mouth with my cum. Mina, at last, released me and rocked back on her knees. I caught a quick glimpse of a trickle of blood trailing from two punctures before Eve took me deeper, pulling me hungrily into her throat. Mina laughed drunkenly, wiping blood from her lips as she watched Eve eagerly swallowing everything I could give her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After that, I lay on the floor, gasping for breath and recovering as the two of them got to their feet and danced slowly together, kissing and caressing each other lovingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I finally stood up and pulled my clothes on, Eve walked me to the door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Here’s some cash for the delivery and a tip for your service. You’ll probably want to pick up some iron supplements. You’re a bit anemic now, but a good night of sleep will see you right as rain.” She gave me a quick kiss on the cheek and handed me the hot bag, giggling as she closed the door. “You can keep the pizza.”&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://rubypinkromance.com/images/treaty-station-MnsqaNKy4_-512w.jpeg&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;“Ambassador Patel, we are approaching Treaty Station,” announced the ship’s AI pilot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Thank you,” she responded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ship was a small one. Her position qualified her for something larger, with room for support staff, but she preferred this simpler, automated model. If asked, she explained it as a cost-saving measure. No need for support staff on a largely ceremonial annual visit. After all, she would chuckle knowingly, it wasn’t like the aliens were going to show up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Divya had a secret. The aliens &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; show up. Every year. This would be her seventh encounter with them. And she’d never told anyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, they hadn’t always. In fact, that was why Divya had been able to gain the position. There was no real competition for ambassador to a race of aliens that wanted nothing to do with humanity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two generations ago, as humans spread outward from their solar system, the question of extraterrestrial life had finally been answered, in the least satisfying way possible, when human ships encountered nonhuman craft with no interest in us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They made no effort to communicate, and ignored all our attempts to do so. The only thing they did was hold position along an unseen boundary in space. Any attempt by human ships to approach was met by a non-hostile but assertive maneuver to block their way. Eventually, through trial and error, the border was mapped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not wanting to risk upsetting the only other sentient species we’d met, with who-knows-what capabilities, everyone had quickly agreed to respect their space. A station was constructed, and towed into position, directly along the boundary. It had no markings, only two docking ports, one facing human space, and the other facing them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A human ship docked, and the first designated ambassador came aboard, sitting at a large table with a copy of a treaty that basically said, “We’ll stay out of your way, but we’d like to get to know you better.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They had no idea how the aliens would react. Would they understand this was an invitation? Would they come aboard? &lt;em&gt;Could&lt;/em&gt; they come aboard? We didn’t even know if they could tolerate our atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Astonishingly, an alien ship did dock with the station. What happened next was broadcast live across all of human space, and is still, to this day, the most-watched recording of all time. The airlock opened, and a single alien entered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The creature most closely resembled a Portuguese man o’ war. That is, if a man o’ war walked upright on long squid-like tentacles, and had a mantle the size of a horse, with colors rippling along the dorsal ridge like a cuttlefish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It ducked through the airlock and approached the table. The ambassador stood, and recited a small speech that had been meticulously prepared by a crack team of scientists who were practically frothing at their mouths to define the new fields of xenobiology, xenosociology, and xenolinguistics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The alien waited calmly as the ambassador spoke, tentacles rippling gently. When he finished speaking, it turned and left. That was the first and only time anyone saw the aliens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some eighty years later, Divya Patel was offered the no-longer desirable position of ambassador. She had an office in the UN, a small staff, an even smaller budget, and a single responsibility: Visit the treaty station every year, just in case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The previous ambassador, who had served for five years, shook her hand, and recommended she pack some books.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Divya’s first visit to the station had been a surprise. She’d watched the first contact recording as much as anyone else, and thought she knew what to expect: A small room with a rather nice table of dark-stained wood, a UN flag hanging on the wall, and a single chair facing the alien’s door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, the table was pushed up against the wall under the flag to make room for a second-hand sofa on the opposite wall. There was also a cheap flat-pack bookshelf, overflowing with dog-eared paperback novels. Someone had even attempted to make the place more friendly with a few plastic plants on the table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She’d spent her first few hours doing paperwork, but had eventually given into boredom and investigated the bookshelves. A surprising amount were romance novels, and by her third visit, she’d read most of them. On her fourth visit she brought a set of comfortable pajamas, a fuzzy bathrobe, and contributed several steamy new romances to the collection. On her fifth visit, she also brought a vibrator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which is how she found herself naked on her back, legs spread, a book in one hand, magic wand in the other, holding the rumbling head to her clit, when the airlock opened and an alien walked in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Divya squealed, dropped everything, and jumped to her feet, pulling her robe on. She apologized frantically, knowing she was babbling, and that it probably couldn’t understand her anyway. The vibrator was buzzing loudly on the floor. She cursed, switched it off, and kicked it under the couch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The alien stood, impassively, near the entrance, tentacles slowly moving as if flowing in a current.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Divya glanced around and felt a burning shame for her role in the state of the room. It looked less like an embassy and more like a dorm room. She crossed her arms, pulling her robe tighter. The air smelled like sex. Her heart was pounding with a mixture of panic and lingering arousal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slowly, it dawned on her that she was only the second human in history to be in the presence of an alien. Was it the same one? How long did they live? She stared, trying to compare it to her memory of the one from the recording. That one’s mantle was a darker shade of purple, she thought, while this one had more of a zebra-stripe pattern fading from a dark cerulean to a bright lavender.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her eyes constantly drifted back to the tentacles. They rippled and flowed in constant hypnotic motion, fading from a rich brown to a rosy pink. Near the mantle, they were as thick as her thigh, but they tapered down to a bulbous, ridged tip. She shook her head, unsure if they’d always looked so phallic, or if her mind was simply primed to see them that way due to her frustrated masturbation session.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Um,” she cleared her throat, with as much dignity as she could muster, reminding herself she had a job to do. “Welcome aboard. I am Ambassador Patel, and, um, I…” Her mind was a blank. There was something she was supposed to say. Some speech written decades before. The binder! She turned to the bookshelf, pulled down a faded three-ring binder, and flipped through the pages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Where is it, where is it,” she muttered. “Ah, here! On behalf of the human race, I, um…” She trailed off as the alien drifted toward her. One tentacle reached up, and gently pushed the binder away. Following its lead, she stopped reading and placed it on the table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She gazed up at the colors rippling along its dorsal ridge. Was that how they communicated? Its tentacles waved gently as it came closer. She backed away, then stopped, unsure if that would be considered an insult. It raised one arm, and tentatively brushed against her cheek, as tender as a new lover.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She’d expected it to feel cold and clammy, but it was smooth and hot to the touch. She shivered as the tip trailed down her neck. A second arm joined the first, and they slipped into her robe, following her collarbone in opposite directions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the tentacles were quite flexible, the ends were a bit stiffer, with taut skin, and a clearly defined ridge. It really was astonishingly like a human erection. An odd coincidence of evolution that would have been fascinating in any other context, but was currently causing her to have a rather inappropriate physical reaction as the firm tips moved along her shoulders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Divya struggled to remain professional. She was an ambassador of the human race, and this was the most interest the aliens had ever expressed. They had no eyes as far as she could tell. Perhaps they communicated by touch. This could simply be the alien equivalent of a handshake. She resolved to not ruin their second chance at alien relations by being prudish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She exhaled shakily and released her grip on the robe as it was parted by the wandering tentacles. Additional arms joined the first two, and her skin felt hot as they boldly explored her body. She felt a tip tracing her spine, another moving along her hip, one sliding down her belly, and one wandering over her chest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tips fumbled aimlessly, prodding her armpit, bumping along her knee, teasing along the cleft of her buttocks. One tangled curiously through her hair, while another wrapped around her breast, drawing a surprised inhalation from her as it squeezed gently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The colors on its mantle seemed to flush red, though surely, it was anthropomorphizing to see that as a sexual response. Even so, Divya found herself trembling as she parted her legs and arms to allow the alien complete access to her body. The tentacle fondling her breast seemed to be contracting rhythmically, and the surprisingly dexterous tip was nudging deliciously against her stiffened nipple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An arm moved sinuously around her leg, wandering up her thigh slowly enough to leave her tense with anticipation. Abandoning her hair, that tip softly explored her face, brushing over her eyelids, pressing against the tip of her nose, and tracing over her lips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She gasped as the tip that had been caressing her back and buttocks slipped between her thighs from behind, teasing her most sensitive spots. Perhaps sensing a change, it moved back and forth, rubbing against the wetness coating her still-swollen lips, and sending waves of sensation rippling through her body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No longer able to resist, Divya gave up any further attempts at professionalism. She rocked shamelessly back and forth, gasping and sliding her slick lips over the firm heat between her legs. Another tentacle wrapped around her other breast, stimulating her nipple. She knew it was foolish to read human motivations into an alien creature, but it was hard not to think it was trying to cause her pleasure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tip that was exploring her mouth probed between her lips. Startled, she let out a muffled cry as a thick, firm, heat pushed inward. It started flexing, rubbing along the length of her tongue. Instinctively, she wrapped her lips around it and sucked, her body rocking in the creature’s firm grasp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tentacle that was rubbing between her legs slipped further forward, angling up until the ridged tip was rubbing directly over her clit. Her insides fluttered, and she squeezed her legs around it, moaning around the shaft in her mouth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More and more tentacles roamed her body. How many did it have? There seemed to be an endless number, caressing, prodding, rubbing. Her breasts seemed to swell in the warm massage, nipples pinched and pulled in a way that couldn’t be accidental.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She felt herself lifted off the ground, tentacles wrapping her legs and arms, supporting her back. As her weight shifted and her legs spread, she felt a thick tip pressing against her entrance. She moaned eagerly, squeezing a supporting tentacle encouragingly, and was rewarded. It slipped in, the bulbous head spreading her open. Another hot tentacle rested against her clit, heavy and firm, as the first pushed deeper inside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She could barely focus anymore, but could still see the rippling colors flashing back and forth along the creature’s dorsal ridge. The zebra stripes on its mantle were undeniably throbbing, flashing a dark red in time with her heartbeat. A distant part of her brain wondered what was happening here. Was this mating behavior? A new stage of diplomatic relations? Was she about to be eaten? She couldn’t bring herself to care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tentacle inside her pussy seemed to be swelling, thrusting deep inside and holding before sliding out in a way that dragged the ridge over a spot that made her see flares of color. Her clit thrummed, and her nipples sang under the creature’s touch. Warmth wrapped her skin everywhere as the tentacles coiled around her, supporting her and touching her in ways a human lover never could.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then she felt a new probing against her back door. She arched her back and moaned around the cock-like shaft in her mouth. The tentacles held her firmly in the air, as the heat worked insistently against her tightly clenched ass. She tried to relax, grunting as it writhed, slick with her juices, slowly working its way in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The one in her mouth twitched, and she moaned, tasting something new, a salty flavor that reminded her of the ocean. Was it going to cum? She squirmed in its grasp, both excited and alarmed at the prospect. Some part of her worried if it was safe, but a louder and more primal part of her desperately wanted it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As if sensing her eagerness, it began moving more urgently, thrusting into her from every direction. She sputtered and groaned as it pushed deeper, sliding into her throat. She felt the shaft in her pussy swell until she felt stretched taut as it thrust over and over, alternating strokes with the one in her ass, which seemed to go deeper every time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her climax crashed through her body with astonishing force. She tensed, toes curling, fingers grasping. She felt her core clenching over and over around the intruders, hard and unyielding and radiating heat inside her. One after another, the orgasms rolled over her in waves. They grew so intense she worried she would pass out, but the creature never slowed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Please,” she tried to moan around the throbbing tentacle filling her mouth. She rocked back and forth in the creature’s grasp, cumming again and again as it fucked her relentlessly. Pleasure so overwhelming it was nearly painful. Her nipples sparked electricity down her spine, and her clit buzzed angrily as a tentacle coiled against it, still thrusting into her, and it was too much, too much, too much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Cum,” she begged, unintelligibly, “please!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suddenly, the creature’s entire mantle pulsed red. It began to shake and spasm. She screamed and choked as every tentacle gushed a sticky, viscous liquid over her. It coated her skin, poured down her throat, and flooded her pussy and ass. She felt a wave of euphoria as she frantically swallowed, moaning with relief and squirming in the now-slippery grasp of the tentacles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a moment, the creature shuddered, and withdrew from her all at once. She cried out at the sensation, then found herself being laid gently on the floor, gasping and drenched with the creature’s cum. For a long moment, all she could do was pant, trying to catch her breath and slow her heart rate. Dimly, she heard the sound of the airlock door cycling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When she finally sat up, still shaky, hugging herself in a puddle of fluid, the alien was gone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later, as she cleaned up the mess, she wondered how she would ever report this. She grimaced as she imagined trying to explain why the alien had walked in on her masturbating. Best-case scenario, she was in for some extremely awkward discussions with the scientists and politicians. Worst case, she could go to prison for ruining the only attempt by the aliens to make contact in eighty years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, as she stepped back onto her ship with a day bag containing an extremely soiled bathrobe, she decided not to tell anyone. After all, what was there actually to tell? No communication had taken place. There was, as far as she could tell, no change to the treaty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Better to act like everything was normal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And in the end, it was fine. After all, no one &lt;em&gt;expected&lt;/em&gt; anything to happen, so her standard report raised no eyebrows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following year passed without incident.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Except. Divya could not stop thinking about it. She was constantly distracted. Someone would call on her in a meeting, and she would startle out of a fantasy of being fucked by grasping tentacles. Her dreams became increasingly erotic, while at the same time, no human lover could compare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She started counting the days until the next visit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When she finally made the journey back to Treaty Station, she sat on the couch, wearing a scandalous set of lingerie, vibrating with tension and soaking her panties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the door opened and her alien stepped out, she laughed with relief.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It wasted no time, seeming just as eager as she was. It bent her over the table and took her forcefully from behind, until she cried with passion, and it drenched her with cum again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lingerie was a total loss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next year, she lay on the couch, and it climbed on top of her, caressed her lovingly, then fucked her so hard she saw stars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the year after that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the year after that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the year after that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She no longer felt any guilt or shame for her secret. As far as the rest of the world was concerned, nothing had happened. There was no change in the aliens’ behavior, so why rock the boat?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Someday, she would retire. Maybe she’d reveal the truth then. Or perhaps, when that day came, she would pick another young woman who looked like she could keep a secret, and pass her the keys to the station.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Ambassador Patel, we have docked with Treaty Station. You may go aboard,” announced the ship’s AI pilot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Thank you, ship.” She stood up and loosened the belt on her robe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe someday. But not today.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;“I just wanna get fucked!” Erica blurted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Riley choked and struggled not to spit out her drink.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“No, not just fucked, I wanna get &lt;em&gt;used&lt;/em&gt;!” Her roommate gesticulated drunkenly, spilling her drink on the kitchen floor. “I want a guy to look at me like all he can think about is bending me over, and, and, like, pulling my hair, and screwing the shit out of me! You know what I mean?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Yeah,” Rylie laughed. “I know what you mean.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She had come home to find Erica in tears on the couch. She’d been laid off, and had no idea how she was going to find the money for tuition and rent. Rylie got them some drinks, and did her best to reassure her that things would work out somehow. She’d only intended to help her relax a bit, but had apparently overdone it and landed in drunken confession territory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rylie liked Erica. She was a good roommate. Easy to get along with. Always paid her bills on time, and did her share of the chores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, if pushed, Rylie might have admitted that she thought Erica was just a bit uptight. She dressed conservatively. She didn’t smoke weed. She preferred studying to partying. She’d never once brought home a random guy from the club. Or from anywhere, for that matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which made her aggressive pantomiming and declaration that she wanted someone to “fuck every hole until she couldn’t walk straight” a bit shocking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Erica, I’ve never seen this side of you,” Rylie chuckled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Oh, my older brothers are fuck-ups, so I’ve always been under all this pressure to be the perfect good girl and graduate and do a good job and not ruin my life by getting pregnant or doing drugs or ever having any fun ever.” The words gushed out of her like a burst dam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You know, I think you might need some food,” Rylie said, putting a pot on the stove to make some noodles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“No, what I &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; is to get wrecked by a big fucking cock.” She heaved a sigh and drained what was left of her drink.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rylie nodded understandingly, and replaced her glass with water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m so jealous of you, Ry. You do what you want, how you want. And &lt;em&gt;who&lt;/em&gt; you want! I always meant to ask you to help me with guys, but there were finals and work and stuff. And now I’m gonna have to go back home and live with my mom and get some shitty retail job, and, and, and…” She trailed off, sniffling and blinking away tears.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Hey now, no more of that,” Rylie said, giving her a quick hug while fetching sauce from the fridge. “No one’s moving home. I told you, we’ll figure something out. Then we’ll go dancing, and I’d love to be your wingwoman.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There’s nothing to figure out, it’s too much money,” she gestured dismissively. “Just promise me you’ll get me laid before I leave. Like, &lt;em&gt;proper&lt;/em&gt; laid.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rylie bit her lip as she stirred the sauce into the noodles. She wasn’t sure if what she was about to say was a good idea or not. Despite Erica’s proclamations, it might be a bridge too far for her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Erica, you’re not a virgin, are you?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“No! I’ve done it before. It’s just, you know, been a while. And the guys I have been with? They were sweet and caring and, um…”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Kinda boring?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Yes!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Okay.” She took a deep breath. “What if I could solve both of your problems at the same time?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What are you talking about?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You remember my friend Max?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The fuckboy?” Erica responded, then clapped her hand over her mouth, horrified at what she’d said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s alright,” Rylie laughed, “he &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a fuckboy. Total trust fund kid with no idea how the real world works, and an overinflated ego.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“So why do you hang out with him?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“He’s fun.” Rylie shrugged, dividing the noodles into two bowls. “He likes to party, and &lt;em&gt;loves&lt;/em&gt; being the center of attention. We get into the cool clubs, go to wild places, and meet outrageous people.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Erica took the offered bowl and started eating. Rylie sat down across from her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“And, there is one other reason.” She hesitated long enough for Erica to look up from her noodles. “Sometimes… he pays me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Why does he…” Erica frowned, then opened her eyes wide in realization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s not what you think,” Rylie blurted. “He just pays me to act like his girlfriend.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Do you have sex with him?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“No! Well, kinda?” Rylie blushed. “I only go down on him.” Confessing this to Erica was more awkward than she’d expected. “I told him if he wanted to pay to fuck someone, he could go find a proper escort.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Erica raised an eyebrow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Look, the point is, Max has more money than sense. Early on, he made it clear he likes spending time with me, and would be willing to pay me enough to make up for any work I’d miss if he wants to go party for a weekend or whatever. And then some. We have fun together, and I make some extra cash at the same time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“And the sex?” To Rylie’s relief, Erica sounded more curious than horrified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When we get back to wherever we’re staying, he likes to watch me masturbate.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Then you give him head?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Yeah. I don’t mind after I’m turned on.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Huh.” Rylie considered this for a moment. “Wait, you said you had a way to solve my problems, then you brought up Max?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I know, I know, just hear me out! You want to get properly fucked, right? Well, for all his flaws, Max actually has a pretty nice cock. He’s clean, he’s always respected my boundaries, and I know he’s interested in you.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“He is?” Erica seemed more shocked by this revelation than anything else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Oh yeah. He’s told me before that you could join us anytime. I assumed you wouldn’t be interested in that kind of thing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Um, how much money are we talking about?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Enough to cover your tuition and a few months of rent.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Holy shit, really?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Really,” Rylie nodded. “What do you think?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Fuck it.” Erica grinned. “Two birds with one stone. And I won’t have to move home with Mom! Call Max, tell him I’m in.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Few Days Later&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Where &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; he?” Erica asked again, pacing back and forth. “I thought you said he’d be here at lunch? It’s almost three!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“He said, ‘around lunch,’” Rylie answered from the couch. “Max has never been on time to anything in his life.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Rylie had called Max and explained the situation, he’d enthusiastically agreed, and said he’d pick them up on Friday. Now it was Friday, and Erica was a ball of nerves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Are you sure this isn’t too short on me?” She fretted, tugging at the hem of the skirt she’d borrowed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s not, but even if it was, the whole point is to get you ‘properly fucked,’ remember?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Erica grimaced, hearing her own words quoted back to her. Rylie stood up and squeezed her shoulders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“E, are you sure you’re still into this? It’s not too late for me to call Max and tell him to fuck off.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“No, no, I mean, it’s fine, I just hate waiting.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As if on cue, there was a knock at the door. Rylie gave Erica a quick hug, and let Max in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Ladies! Sorry I’m late, I had lunch with some cryptocurrency guys, and they would &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; stop talking. You know how it is. How ya doing, Rylie?” He gave them both a quick hug, then dropped onto the couch, exhaling noisily. “Whew! Alright, Erica, come here, sit with me. Let’s chat.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She glanced at Rylie, who nodded, then sat down next to Max. Rylie leaned against the wall, curious to see how Max would handle this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I was fucking &lt;em&gt;stoked&lt;/em&gt; when Rylie told me what you’re looking for. You couldn’t have known it, but your timing was perfect. I’ve been sitting on something kinda special, waiting for the right opportunity, and babe, I think it’s for you. Here’s the deal. I’ve got this pill I ordered from a Russian catalog. A buddy tried it, said it’s like hurricane-force Viagra. This little beauty is supposed to let me fuck like a goddamn stallion all day and night.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Erica blushed, but didn’t stop him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Now, you know that Rylie and I have an arrangement. We usually just do a bit of partying, a bit of dancing, then she gives me head. We keep it kinda softcore. Girlfriend experience, you know? I throw her a bit of walking-around money because I was tired of her saying she couldn’t go out because she had to work. So now she can have a good time with me, no worries. And that’s great, I love it, but like you, I am craving that next-level experience. I wanna rock it &lt;em&gt;hardcore&lt;/em&gt;, have a day that we’re both gonna remember when we’re old and gray, you feel me?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She nodded, as if this was a perfectly reasonable thing to say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Cool cool cool. Rylie told me you were looking for a good time, but I get that this is probably gonna be outside your comfort zone. Now, I don’t want you to think I’m paying you to do anything you don’t want to do. I’m gonna push your limits, sure, but what I’m spending my money on is an &lt;em&gt;experience&lt;/em&gt;, one that I think we’re both gonna savor.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Plus,” Rylie interjected, “I’ll be there the whole time to make sure you’re okay. If it’s too much at any point, you just let me know.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Right,” Max nodded emphatically. “So, here’s my dream, and I think this magic pill’s gonna make it happen for us. We’re gonna go out, we’re gonna have a good time. We’re gonna dance, we’re gonna party, and I’m gonna fuck you every hour on the hour.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Every hour?” Erica hesitated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Every hour,” Max nodded, glancing at his watch. “For twelve hours. So what’s it gonna be, babe? Are you in or out?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Um,” She slowly nodded her head. “Yeah. Yeah, I’m in. Let’s do it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Whoo! That’s great fucking news, ’cause I took the pill on the drive over here, that short skirt of yours is driving me crazy, and I’m already hard as a motherfucker!” He looked at his watch, and held up one finger. “Okay, the clock staaarts… now!” A timer chimed, and he quickly unbuttoned his pants to free his cock. True to his word, it looked almost painfully erect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Oh!” Erica gasped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Come on, babe, we’ll start slow. For now, just go down on me.” He rubbed her shoulder encouragingly, pulling her closer as his cock twitched.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She glanced at Rylie, clearly a bit hesitant to do it in front of her. Rylie gave her a wink and a thumbs-up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Oh yeah,” Max groaned, closing his eyes as she lowered her head and wrapped her lips around him. “This pill’s got me really goddamn sensitive!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rylie bit her lip, fascinated by the sight of her uptight roommate bobbing her head in Max’s lap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Jesus, your mouth is so hot! It feels amazing!” Erica made a surprised sound as Max put his hand on the back of her neck, encouraging her to go lower. “Keep going! I’m not gonna last long.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rylie was surprised at how aroused she felt from the sight of Max using Erica’s mouth for his pleasure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Oh fuck! Fuck yeah,” Max grunted as Erica slurped loudly around his cock. “I’m getting close!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He opened his eyes and looked straight at Rylie as he pushed harder on the back of Erica’s head. She didn’t protest, just moaned in response and swallowed him deeper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Your throat,” Max gasped, as Rylie squirmed in sympathy, “so fucking tight!” Erica’s lips finally reached the base of his cock, making him groan loudly. “Fuck! I’m gonna cum!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Erica gripped the edge of the couch cushion tightly as Max started shaking. He grunted with each spasm, still holding her head down as he shot his load into her throat. She moaned, eyes watering, trying to swallow everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At last, he gasped and let go, collapsing back and panting. Erica popped up immediately, coughing and choking, wiping his cum from her lips. She looked at Rylie with surprise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You okay?” Rylie mouthed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Erica nodded, tears running down her cheek, but grinning widely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Holy shit,” Max crowed as he buttoned up his pants. “This is gonna be &lt;em&gt;sick!&lt;/em&gt; Okay, ladies, we got a flight to catch. Tonight, I’m taking you to my buddy’s club in LA. Grab your stuff, real quick-like. Rylie, bring that little red number I bought you last month? Erica, we got just enough time to go buy you something sexy to wear.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Seriously?” Rylie asked. “You’ve got twelve hours, and you want to spend a bunch of them on a plane?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’ll all balance out with the time zone change,” Max shrugged, unconcerned. “Hustle up!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4 P.M.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An hour later, Rylie was sitting with Max on the bench outside a changing room. Erica was inside trying on a handful of dresses. The saleswoman had been a bit rude until Max had flashed his credit card. Suddenly, she’d been more than willing to help Erica, who seemed a bit overwhelmed by the fancy shop, pick out a few things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“How’s this one? Is it too much?” Erica pulled back the curtain a bit timidly. She’d had to remove her bra, and the loose purple fabric plunged daringly from her shoulders, exposing quite a bit of pale skin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Whoo!” Rylie grinned. “Your tits look great. Can you dance in it?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Erica hesitated, then lifted her arms to sway to an imaginary beat. The dress barely clung to her curves, and started to shift away from her breasts. She squealed and pulled it back into place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s good.” Max nodded appreciatively. “Do you like this one or the green one better?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Um,” she considered, “I think the green one would be better for dancing?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Done deal.” He nodded, glancing at his watch. “But, uh, don’t take that one off just yet.” He stood up and put an arm around her waist, pulling her into the changing room. As the timer beeped again, he winked at Rylie and closed the curtain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Erica squealed in mock protest. The saleswoman looked up at the noise and narrowed her eyes when she noticed Max was missing. Rylie shrugged in a “what are you gonna do” kind of way. The saleswoman sighed and busied herself with neatening the already well-organized displays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rylie grinned and turned her attention to the curtain. It wasn’t quite closed all the way, and from where she sat, she could see a narrow view of Erica and Max’s reflections in the mirror. Erica had dropped to her knees, allowing the dress to fall down her arms, exposing her breasts, which she was pushing together around Max’s cock. He was whispering something while thrusting urgently into her cleavage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She looked flushed, with a mixture of arousal and concern on her face, no doubt worried they’d get caught. Max clearly didn’t care about anything except the way her tits felt around his shaft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rylie crossed her legs, once again surprised at how erotic she found the sight of them together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Erica was awkwardly leaning forward, trying to lick the tip of his cock at the peak of each thrust. Max grimaced as her tongue teased him and said something Rylie couldn’t hear. Erica looked up at him, eyes wide, as he shoved her back against the wall and fucked against her chest harder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abruptly, he stiffened, and Erica let out a surprised sound as thick white cum splattered her chest. It shot across her collarbone and fell across her breasts. She eagerly leaned down to wrap her lips around him, sucking and swallowing the last of his climax as his spunk dripped down her nipples onto the purple fabric.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He stepped backward, and walked calmly, if a little winded, from the dressing room. The saleswoman frowned and pretended not to notice him buttoning his pants as he approached the counter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“She’ll take the green one,” he announced. “And the purple one, too. We, uh, spilled something on it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5 P.M.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Max drove like a bat out of hell to get them to the private jet terminal at the airport in time for their flight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Not like they’d leave without us,” Max laughed dismissively, “but I got a schedule to keep.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plane was small but luxurious. The cabin had just four seats, all facing each other, more than like recliners than airliner seats. The flight attendant got them all seated, and disappeared into a small galley area as the plane took off. After reaching altitude, she reappeared with glasses of champagne.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rylie sat across from Max and Erica, sipping her drink and curious to see what Max would do at the top of the hour. Erica seemed intrigued as well, but Max just grinned and made small talk until the timer on his watch went off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Erica,” he grinned, obviously pleased with himself. “Want to join the mile-high club?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What, you mean in there?” She shot a hesitant look toward the restroom door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“No, babe, right here.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Here?” Erica looked apprehensive. “What if the flight attendant comes back?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“She won’t. Passengers on flights like this value their privacy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Um,” she hesitated, shooting a nervous glance at Rylie. “Okay. Yeah. Uh, how do you want to…”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I want you to come ride my cock.” Without waiting, he lowered his pants to around his ankles. His cock jutted upward, already hard and eagerly twitching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Oh!” Erica grinned and reached under her skirt to slip off her panties, then moved to straddle him in the oversized seat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rylie bit her lip as she watched Erica wiggle her hips, imagining the way she was positioning Max at her entrance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Max grinned as Erica slowly lowered herself, one hand on his shoulder, the other between her legs. Her skirt was draped over them, blocking Rylie’s view, but she could tell the moment he filled her from the way Erica shivered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slowly, she started moving on top of him, lifting and lowering herself. She gasped every time he slid home. From behind, Rylie couldn’t see her expression, but the tilt of her head and the way she squirmed told her everything she needed to know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a few minutes of slow, sensual build-up, Max’s hands appeared on her waist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is nice and all, but I want you to &lt;em&gt;ride&lt;/em&gt; me!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Erica squealed as he pushed her forcefully down onto him. He squeezed her hips tightly, tugging her up and slamming her down over and over. She cried out every time he thrust upward to meet her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Yeah, like that,” he groaned, “fuck me hard!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Oh my god!” Erica moaned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rylie squirmed. The cabin smelled like sex, and hearing the wet sounds of their fucking was almost more erotic than if she could see Max’s cock plowing into Erica.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Fuck!” Max grunted. “Your pussy! Feels so good!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Yes!” Erica cried over and over. “Yes, yes, yes…”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m gonna fuck this pussy all night long!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Yes, fuck me,” she moaned. “Use me! Oh god, use me!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m cumming!” He groaned, slamming her down one last time and holding her in place with white knuckles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Ah!” She grasped the headrest of his seat as he shuddered between her thighs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a long minute, he let her go. She quickly got to her feet and ran to the bathroom, hand between her legs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Holy shit,” he grinned, lazily stroking his cock, which glistened with Erica’s juices. “This is fucking incredible. I gotta get more of these pills.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rylie didn’t say anything. Her jeans suddenly seemed very tight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6 P.M.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few glasses of champagne later, Erica was laughing as Rylie and Max shared a story about a night clubbing when Max’s timer went off again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Erica set her glass aside and looked expectantly at Max, who was already unbuttoning his pants. As before, his cock sprang forth, erect and ready to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once again, he had Erica sit in his lap and ride him, gripping her hips tightly and fucking her against him until she was moaning with every thrust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rylie watched, and hoped it wasn’t obvious how turned on she was. She hadn’t really considered what effect it would have on her to watch them fuck over and over again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Erica seemed overwhelmed, wordlessly groaning and gasping as he took full advantage of her body. Rylie hoped the experience was living up to her fantasy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Max stared lustily at Erica’s bouncing tits, not caring at all that Rylie was there. If anything, it seemed to excite him to have an audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At last, he came inside her again, cursing triumphantly the entire time. Erica threw her head back and gasped at the sensation, before climbing shakily to her feet and stumbling to the restroom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This time, Rylie followed her, slipping into the tiny room with her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Erica looked surprised, but quickly sat on the toilet to wipe up the cum leaking out of her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Are you doing okay?” Rylie asked, worried she’d gotten her friend in over her head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Okay?” Erica laughed shakily. “God, I’m fucking dripping! The idea that he’s just going to keep taking me like this all night? Using my body for his pleasure? It’s incredible.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Are you sure? It kinda seems like… a lot.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m good, Ry, I promise.” She stood up and pulled her into a hug.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7 P.M.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’ll be landing soon,” Max said, the next time his watch beeped. “Get on your knees. I wanna fuck you from behind.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Where?” Erica looked around for a good spot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Right here,” Max said, gesturing at the floor between their seats and Rylie’s. The seats were big, but the cabin wasn’t, and there wasn’t enough space between the seats for what Max had in mind without practically doing it in Rylie’s lap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“But,” Erica protested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Rylie can switch seats if she wants,” Max said, with a grin. “Or she can stay there. I think she’s enjoying watching us fuck, and wouldn’t mind a closer view.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rylie fought back a blush at Max’s observation, and focused on Erica, trying to read how she felt about this suggestion. She looked surprised, Rylie thought, but not opposed to the idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“E, I told you I’d be here the whole time, to make sure you’re okay. But if you want, I can move.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“No,” Erica gulped, dropping to her knees. “You should stay here! To, um, keep an eye on things…”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Awesome,” Max grinned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They got in position. There was just enough room for Max to kneel behind her, practically with his butt still in the seat. Rylie had to spread her legs to let Erica brace herself on her seat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Erica looked up at Rylie with wide eyes as Max lifted her skirt and rubbed the head of his cock against her. She opened her mouth to say something, but before she could, Max thrust forward, burying himself completely. She groaned, mouth wide, as he started fucking her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rylie could no longer pretend the situation wasn’t turning her on. Erica swaying between her thighs with every thrust. Max grinning like a wolf, knew full well the effect this was having on her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He slapped Erica’s ass, making her squeal and grab Rylie’s leg. He fucked her harder, pushing forward with more force, shoving her closer to Rylie, who was gripping the armrest tightly. The lust in Erica’s eyes, gazing up at her and squeezing her leg, caused an intense heat to blossom in her core.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Rylie,” she gasped, “He’s so deep!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Yeah,” Rylie breathed, unable to form a more coherent thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Max groaned loudly, fucking her relentlessly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I, oh!” Erica moaned. “I think, ah, I think I’m gonna cum!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Fuck yeah,” Max growled. “Me too!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Oh!” Erica gasped again. “Oh my god!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She dropped her head onto Rylie’s hip and dug her fingernails into her thigh. She groaned loudly, sending a wave of sensation through Rylie, who struggled to contain herself as Max continued fucking Erica against her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abruptly he cried out, staring wild-eyed and rocking with each pulse of his orgasm. Rylie shuddered as he and Erica came together, practically in her lap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8 P.M.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I know this incredible Korean fusion place. You ladies are gonna love it,” Max exclaimed as he sped down the street, weaving in and out of traffic in the Mustang he’d had waiting for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The restaurant turned out to be a confusing blend of styles. The decor was old-school high-class dining, with tablecloths, fancy chairs, and candles. The dim lighting barely concealed that the restaurant had been through multiple styles and cuisines as the owner jumped from trend to trend. Despite that, the dining room was crowded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The head waiter recognized Max and escorted them to a reserved table in the back corner. Max sat with his back to the wall as the waiter gave them menus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The food turned out to be quite good, though Rylie was a bit distracted by Erica’s nervousness. Her eyes kept darting to the clock on the wall, ticking closer and closer to the top of the hour. She scanned around the dining room, unsure what Max would suggest. Surely, he wasn’t planning to fuck her over the table in front of everyone?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When his timer finally beeped, Erica was practically vibrating with anticipation. He calmly reached down to unbutton his pants. Rylie glanced around the dining room, but their position in the back meant no one noticed he’d just pulled out his throbbing erection. He grinned at Erica and gestured with his eyes for her to go under the table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her cheeks flushed, but she licked her lips. After looking around to make sure no one was watching, she quickly ducked under the tablecloth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rylie couldn’t believe it. The tablecloth wasn’t very long, but the dim lighting meant anyone not looking carefully could easily miss the sight of Erica crouching under the table. And while the wet sounds of her increasingly enthusiastic blowjob seemed painfully obvious to Rylie, the music was apparently loud enough to keep anyone from noticing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What do you think of your—ah—kimchi tacos?” Max asked, as if his cock wasn’t in someone’s mouth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rylie didn’t bother answering. She felt flushed, and took a sip of water. Why was this so exciting? Her heart was pounding. She wasn’t even really involved, but sitting here while it happened, &lt;em&gt;knowing&lt;/em&gt; it was happening, made her feel like she was part of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Max shivered in response to some unseen stimulus. He gripped the edge of the table tightly and laughed in surprise. He scooted so low in his chair that Rylie worried he might fall out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“How is everything?” The waiter appeared suddenly. “Would you like any dessert?” Max could only shake his head, with a screwed-up expression on his face. The waiter looked momentarily concerned, but Rylie assured him the food was excellent, and they would not be having dessert. “Very good. And the other young lady?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“She, um, stepped away to powder her nose.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The waiter nodded, and moved on to another table, politely ignoring whatever was going on with Max.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Oh, fuck me,” he groaned quietly as soon as the waiter was out of earshot. “I started cumming just as he walked up!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rylie bit her lip and watched as Max squirmed. She imagined Erica under the table, lips wrapped around his throbbing cock, milking the last of his orgasm. Suddenly, he shuddered and sat up straight, breathing heavily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A moment later, Erica reappeared, climbing quickly back into her seat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Holy shit,” Max laughed giddily as she took a drink of water. “You are amazing. This is the best money I’ve ever spent!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Erica blushed furiously, but looked pleased.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9 P.M.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There’s no point showing up to the club before midnight,” Max declared as he drove to the hotel. “We’ll get checked in here and kill a bit of time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Predictably, the suite was ostentatious. It was larger than their apartment. Hell, it was larger than her parent’s house. It had multiple rooms, a chandelier, a fireplace, and a jaw-dropping view of downtown L.A.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They were all standing on the balcony when Max’s watch beeped. Rylie watched, amused, as he kicked off his pants, stepped behind Erica, and lifted her skirt. She spread her legs and arched her back as he gripped his swollen prick and angled it to meet her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Oh!” She gasped as he slipped easily inside. Apparently, she wasn’t exaggerating about how wet the situation made her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Max wasted no time, grabbing her hips and thrusting eagerly. Erica braced herself on the chest-height glass railing. Rylie couldn’t help but notice that she was pushing back to meet him on every thrust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Biting her lip and trying to ignore the insistent heat between her thighs, Rylie turned her gaze outward. There was another hotel across the street, and she scanned the windows idly. In one room, a family was putting their kids to sleep. In another, a man lay in bed watching TV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And in one room, almost directly across from them, a woman wearing expensive lingerie stood at the window. She stretched languidly as a nude man appeared from behind and kissed her neck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rylie was distracted from the sight when Erica swore loudly. Max had grabbed her hair and yanked her head back, making her cry out with a mix of pleasure and pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Rylie looked back across the street, she was surprised to see the couple looking in their direction. The woman tapped the man and pointed. He followed her gesture and smiled when he spotted the three of them on the balcony. He said something in the woman’s ear that made her laugh, and caressed her body as they watched.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Hey Erica,” Rylie said, “you’ve got an audience.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What?” Erica groaned. “What do you mean?” She opened her eyes and followed Rylie’s finger, pointing to the couple across the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Oh my god!” She squealed. “They’re watching us?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Awesome!” Max looked over her shoulder, saw the other couple, and laughed. He tugged Erica’s hair harder, forcing her more upright, and continued fucking her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Max,” Erica moaned, “They can see us!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Yeah,” he agreed. “It’s hot, right?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Oh god,” she moaned. “Oh fuck!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rylie tried not to squirm as she discreetly squeezed her thighs together. Watching Erica give in to lust was turning her on more than she wanted to admit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Get ready,” Max growled, “I’m close.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Will you—ah!” Erica struggled to ask, “cum on my face?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You want them to see me cum on you?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Yes! Oh fuck, yes, cum all over me!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Get on your knees!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rylie and the couple across the street stared as Erica dropped in front of Max. He stroked his cock, pointing it at her lips. She panted with desire, one hand under her skirt, shamelessly rubbing her clit. She gasped as hot cum splashed across her face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Stand up, babe, show them how sexy you look.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Erica climbed shakily to her feet, and turned to face the couple across the way. They grinned and waved. She waved back, laughing deliriously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10 P.M.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An hour later, the three of them were sprawled across the enormous bed in the master suite. Erica had washed her face while Max ordered some fruit to snack on and Rylie watched a baking competition on the obscenely large television.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Max hadn’t bothered to put his pants back on after cleaning up, so Rylie could see that even after cumming, the pill kept him hard. He lounged on the bed between them, legs spread, cock resting on his stomach, faintly throbbing with his heartbeat. He noticed her looking, and winked. His cock twitched eagerly, as if pleased by her attention. She rolled her eyes and turned back to the TV, pretending she hadn’t felt an answering flutter inside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When his timer went off, Erica put down her grapes and sat up eagerly to see what he wanted her to do. She’d discarded her bra and top, and her nipples looked almost as stiff as Max’s cock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He stood up and walked to the foot of the bed, turning to face them. Erica followed on her hands and knees, and enthusiastically wrapped her lips around his head. He laced his fingers in her hair, and she moaned as he pushed deeper into her mouth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rylie sat awkwardly against the headboard. The heat between her thighs was impossible to deny. She bit her knuckle and stared, trying to resist the urge to pinch her nipples or shove a hand down her pants. It was confusing. She was just here to make sure Max didn’t get out of line. Being used for someone else’s pleasure was Erica’s fantasy, not hers. So why was she so turned on?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Rylie,” Max said, snapping her out of a haze.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Huh? Nothing. What?” She crossed her arms over her chest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s okay,” he grinned, still thrusting into Erica’s mouth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What’s okay?” She was genuinely confused, and distracted by Erica’s quiet moans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I can tell this is turning you on. Why don’t you touch yourself?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I, um, no, I mean…” She found it difficult to answer, distracted by the sight of Erica’s lips finally reaching the base of his shaft. He groaned and held her there for a long moment until she started choking. Eyes watering, she quickly turned around on her hands and knees so he could fuck her from behind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Come on—ah!” He gasped as Erica slipped him inside. “You masturbate for me all the time. Why is this different?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I… I mean, it’s…” Rylie stammered, unable to take her eyes off Erica’s face as Max started fucking her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Rylie,” Erica whimpered, “please…”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Oh fuck,” she groaned, unable to resist any longer. Erica and Max watched hungrily as she peeled her clothes off. She squeezed her breasts, nipples puckering eagerly with the long-denied stimulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Watch this, Erica,” Max murmured. “She’s so fucking hot when she gets off.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Erica could only moan in agreement as Rylie leaned back and spread her legs. Her lips were already puffy and sensitive, and she gasped as she spread her wetness with her fingers. Max grinned, the way he always did when she started rubbing circles around her clit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Did it turn you on, watching us all day?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rylie groaned, unable to deny it, but reluctant to say so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I knew it!” He laughed. “On the balcony, I thought for sure you were gonna rub one out while they watched us fuck!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I almost did,” she breathed, picking up the pace. “It turned me on so much.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Back at your apartment, I could tell you were shocked when I made her suck my cock, but you never looked away.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I couldn’t,” she admitted, then tried to make an excuse. “I had to make sure you didn’t overdo it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That’s not why, though,” he laughed. “Come on!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It was hotter than I thought,” she conceded, “watching the two of you.” She groaned as she pushed two fingers inside, while continuing to rub her clit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Then on the plane, when I fucked her into your lap, I thought you were either gonna kiss her or make her eat you out!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Erica let out a squeal, and looked up at Rylie with startled longing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Max, shut the fuck up,” Rylie moaned, feeling the pressure building. Erica was staring, grasping at the blanket as Max started fucking her harder, slamming into her from behind. Rylie’s insides were starting to clench around her fingers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Erica came first. She slapped the bed and screamed, burying her face in the blanket, shaking uncontrollably. Max kept his grip on her hips, holding her up as he fucked her, relentlessly working toward his climax.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rylie grunted as all her muscles seemed to contract at once. She felt a hot gush around her fingers as waves of pleasure radiated from her core. This orgasm had been building all day, and the release was nearly overwhelming. Her entire body seemed to be pulsing, clenching, thrumming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sight of Rylie cumming pushed Max over the edge. He groaned and shoved Erica down onto her stomach with one final thrust, collapsing on top of her. She moaned happily as he came inside her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rylie kept her palm clamped over her clit, legs shaking and head swimming with confusing thoughts about both Max and Erica.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;11 P.M.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like everything else in the hotel room, the shower was absurdly large. The tiled space could easily accommodate multiple people. There were several rainfall shower heads mounted to the ceiling, and a surprising array of pleasant-smelling body washes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Jesus, this feels amazing,” Erica purred, standing under one of the shower heads and letting the water cascade down her back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Right?” Rylie grinned. “A girl could get used to this.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rylie had been pleasantly surprised when Erica followed her, giggling, into the steamy spray. There was little trace remaining of her shy, uptight roommate. This new Erica was reveling in her newly claimed sexuality, and after letting Rylie watch her get fucked repeatedly, sharing a shower was apparently no big deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I, um…” Rylie started to ask something and then changed her mind. “Just to be clear, are you still doing okay with all this?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m more than okay!” Erica laughed, “Oh my god, this is, like, &lt;em&gt;revelatory&lt;/em&gt;. I’ll need to process a bit at some point, but, yeah, it’s everything I wanted. Thank you so much for setting this up.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Good, good.” Rylie rolled her neck. She meant to ask about the way Erica looked at her on the bed, and on the plane. But she wasn’t quite sure of her own feelings. It was complicated because Max was involved. Or was it? Maybe she was overthinking it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before she could work out what to say, a now-familiar beeping sound announced Max as he strolled erection-first into the bathroom. Erica squealed excitedly as he joined them in the shower.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rylie quickly rinsed off as Max turned Erica around, pushed her up against the wall, and shoved his cock between her legs. She gasped and arched her back, angling to meet him as he started fucking her hard and fast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Retreating to dry her hair in the next room, still confusingly aroused, Rylie turned up the TV to cover the sound of Erica’s moans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Midnight&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At last, Max decided it was time to head to the club.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Never show up early, ladies. Like the bard said, the party don’t start ’till we walk in.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That’s a line from a Kesha song, you dork.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What can I say, I love the classics. Let’s get dressed!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After they changed into their dresses, Max tossed his keys to Rylie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Wanna drive?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The Mustang?” She grinned. “Hell yeah.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The car was stupidly fun to drive. The motor growled like a beast waiting to be let off the leash. At a red light, a car pulled up alongside, low-slung, with neon lights underneath, revving a challenge. Max and Erica laughed from the back seat as she gunned it, effortlessly leaping ahead of the other car when the light turned green. She was having so much fun, she barely noticed Max’s watch was beeping again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Max!” Erica giggled. “My dress!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Just pull it up and sit in my lap, babe,” he replied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glancing in the rearview, she caught a glimpse of Erica straddling Max, with her dress hitched up over her hips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You guys better be quick,” Rylie laughed. “We’re almost there!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Just—ah—park in the back,” Max groaned, slightly muffled by Erica’s cleavage. “We’ll use the VIP entrance.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As she pulled into a small parking lot, an attendant with a clipboard gestured for her to stop and roll down the window.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Name?” He asked, sounding bored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Um, Max?” Rylie said, trying to sound like someone who used VIP entrances all the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Not on the list,” he replied after a quick scan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rylie was surprised to hear Max’s window rolling down. Erica squealed as the attendant looked in, but Max kept a firm grip on her hips and didn’t let her move away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’ve got a standing invite,” he groaned, encouraging Erica to keep moving. “Text Stevie and—ah—tell him Max flew in for the night.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The attendant barely raised an eyebrow at the sight of them fucking in the back seat. Rylie wondered what kind of things he saw regularly in this job to leave him so nonplussed. He pulled out his phone and started typing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Erica, after the initial moment of surprise, seemed to decide she didn’t mind an audience and resumed bouncing enthusiastically on Max’s cock. Her moans of pleasure did get a bit more performative, Rylie couldn’t help but notice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Alright,” the attendant finally replied, ignoring Erica. “He says you’re on the list. You can park over there.” He walked away, casually gesturing to a space between two other expensive cars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Are you,” Erica gasped as Rylie parked. “Are you—oh!—gonna cum soon?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Yeah,” Max growled. “You want it in your mouth or your pussy?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rylie turned around in her seat to watch, curious what Erica would decide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Oh fuck!” Erica seemed unsure. “I—ah!—You…”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Choose quick!” Max groaned, his eyes screwed shut as he tried to hold back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“My mouth,” Erica squealed. She jumped off him just as his cock started throbbing, and wrapped her lips tightly around his head. She moaned happily as she swallowed, stroking his shaft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rylie unconsciously squeezed her breasts at the sight. Max’s eyes were screwed shut, and he rocked in place, unaware of anything beyond the pleasure of cumming in the heat of Erica’s mouth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, he collapsed. Erica quickly opened the car door and climbed out, wiping her chin and shimmying her dress back down over her hips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Max, hurry up,” she laughed. “I wanna dance!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1 A.M.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the next hour, Erica commanded the dance floor. Rylie was genuinely impressed. Her dancing was uninhibited, as if she was celebrating a new perspective on life. People seemed to orbit her, sometimes swinging closer, sometimes peeling off, burned by flying too close to the sun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rylie stayed close, at times dancing with Erica, or moving back when she seemed to vibe with someone. Mostly men would cruise by, hoping to get close to Erica. Occasionally, she would let them. Their hands would roam over her hips, or wrap around her back, trying to pull her in, but they seemed unable to keep ahold of her, and she would move on to a new partner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several women came in as well. One moved in time with the beat, standing behind Erica, hands exploring her sides. Another joined her from the front, their legs twined together as they moved in time. Rylie felt her heart beating faster as the women caressed Erica’s body, grinding with her to the pounding beat. But when one leaned in as if to kiss her, Erica slipped away, finding Max in the crowd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Max seemed to instinctively understand that any attempt to constrain Erica or keep her to himself would backfire. He enthusiastically danced nearby, matching her energy, with an effortless confidence that came from knowing he would claim her again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As if sensing Rylie’s thoughts, Max glanced down at his watch, and showed it to Erica, who allowed him to lead her from the dance floor. On the way, he caught Rylie’s eye and gestured toward the bathrooms. With a shared sense of excitement, they moved through the crowd together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Erica didn’t hesitate to pull Max into an open stall in the women’s room. Rylie took a spot at the counter near other women checking their makeup and gossiping. A few eyebrows were raised when they went in the stall together, but it was clearly a common enough occurrence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A moment later, there was a thump against the door, followed by the sound of Erica moaning. With every passing moment, she got louder, and more of the girls started laughing, or openly staring at the stall door, thumping against the flimsy frame so hard it looked like it might crash open.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once again, Rylie was struck by the change in her roommate. If you had told her the day before that Erica would be getting loudly fucked in a public restroom at a club, she would have laughed. It was completely out of character.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Fuck!” Erica screamed as the thumping got faster. “Fuck me harder!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rylie wished she had followed them into the stall. It was a dumb thought, there’d be no room for her, but she wanted to see the look on Erica’s face. She imagined a gleam of excitement in her eyes, genuine lust mixed with the thrill of performing in public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Max let out a loud groan, there was one last final slam against the door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few moments later, the stall opened and Erica walked out, adjusting her dress. She was blushing, but looked pleased with herself. Several of the women applauded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Max followed in her wake, tossing off a casual wink at the catcalls he received as they returned to the dance floor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2 A.M.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later, after more drinking and dancing, Max escorted Rylie and Erica back out the VIP entrance. The night air felt cool compared to the packed club.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That was so much fun!” Erica said, spinning giddily as they crossed the parking lot. “Why are we leaving?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s last call in a few minutes,” Max explained. “The club’ll clear out after that, and I’m a big believer in leaving a party before it winds down.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They were a few steps from the exit when Max’s timer went off. They all stopped for a moment and looked at each other, then Erica ran the last few steps to the car.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Come on, we can do it in the back seat again!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rylie nodded and opened the driver’s door, but stopped to look when Erica squealed. She was bent over, starting to climb into the car, but Max had grabbed her hips from behind, holding her in the open door. He started lifting her dress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Max!” She laughed and swatted at him, but he kept going, pulling it up to expose the fact that she had no panties on. “Here in the parking lot?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I said every hour on the hour, babe. I’m not waiting to feel your hot little pussy around my cock again.” He quickly unbuttoned his pants. Rylie couldn’t tell if she was imagining that his cock looked even more swollen than earlier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Okay, but—OH!” Erica barked in surprise as Max filled her with one eager thrust. “Oh fuck, we’re outside! Uh! Anyone—ah!—could see!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There’s no one to see except a bartender having a smoke,” Max groaned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Oh my god!” Erica moaned. “Is he watching? Ah! Is he watching you fuck me?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rylie glanced around. There was indeed a dude in a tight black shirt smoking near the door. It was a small parking lot, and they were only a couple car lengths away. He could clearly see them from where he was standing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Yeah, he’s watching,” Max growled. “He’s into it, too. After we finish, I bet he’s gonna go jerk off.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Erica slapped the seat and moaned at the thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rylie glanced in the direction of the bartender, who, despite Max’s description, seemed only mildly curious. She climbed into the driver’s seat, closed the door, and adjusted the rearview mirror so she could see the back seat. Erica’s tits were threatening to fall out of her top with each thrust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quickly, Rylie hitched up her own dress, pushed her panties to one side and ran a finger through the wetness coating her lips. She watched Erica moaning and swaying, gripping the edge of the seat. Max was barely visible, urgently fucking her through the open door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rylie slipped one finger inside as Erica’s top finally lost the battle, and her breasts spilled out. Her lips were parted, eyes wide with lust, but unfocused. Rylie imagined climbing into the back seat with her. She couldn’t tell if she wanted to kiss Erica, suck on her nipples, or push her out of the way and take her place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Max groaned loudly and gave her ass a slap, making Erica cry out in surprise. Rylie pushed another finger inside. She remembered being on the plane as Max fucked Erica into her lap. Imagined that she had spread her legs, and made Erica go down on her. She rubbed her clit, imagining it was Erica’s tongue, with Max grinning and thrusting harder, as if he was using Erica to fuck Rylie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m gonna cum,” Max groaned. “I’m gonna flood your fucking pussy…”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Oh!” Erica cried out. “Oh fuck! Yes!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rylie bit her lip and fucked herself in time with Max’s thrusts until he grunted, pushing deep inside and holding there. Erica moaned long and low, whimpering as Max came deep inside. Rylie felt her insides clenching around her fingers and imagined it was her bent over in the back seat instead of Erica.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3 A.M.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Rylie, the next hour passed in a haze of sexual tension.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Erica cuddled with her on the bed, idly flipping channels on the television. Once they’d returned to the hotel room, she and Rylie had both shed their club clothes, and put on a pair of soft hotel bathrobes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Erica didn’t seem anxious anymore. Somewhere in the course of the day, she’d given herself over fully to the experience. The waiting, the not knowing what Max was going to do to her next, it was all part of it. She fairly radiated satisfaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Max lounged in an armchair, scrolling on his phone. The only sign that he wasn’t completely chill was the constant nervous tapping of his foot. His twelve hours were nearly up. He had one more turn with Erica, and Rylie figured he was trying to think of a way to make it count.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rylie’s head was still swimming with confused arousal. She was extremely aware of the heat of Erica’s body, snuggled against hers. Spending the entire day watching the two of them fuck had left her flooded with lust. She still wasn’t sure if it was mostly aimed at Max or Erica.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Max’s timer went off, he stood up, stretched, and quickly undressed. Standing at the foot of the bed, his cock jutted upward, swollen with need. Erica quickly shucked her robe and crawled, nude, towards him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What do you want to do, Max?” She purred seductively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Lay on your back, babe, I want to watch your face while I fuck you.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She giggled and lay down, spreading her legs invitingly. Max stepped forward, and rubbed the head of his cock between her lips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rylie got to her knees so she could see better. Instinctively, she held her robe closed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They all watched him push slowly inside, drawing a moan from Erica as her lips parted around him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Fuck,” he exhaled. “Your pussy is so hot!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Oh!” Erica gasped, as he lifted her ankles to his shoulders, and slipped deeper inside. “Yes! Your cock fills me up so good.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rylie reached inside her robe, squeezing her breast and feeling the nipple tighten under her palm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slowly, Max started moving his hips. Erica laid her head back, eyes closed. Her hands moved restlessly over the blanket, gripping it every time he pushed inside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“How about it, Rylie,” Max asked, “wanna touch yourself again? It turns me on to watch you rub your clit while I fuck your friend in front of you.” Erica moaned at this, and opened her eyes to see what Rylie would do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking in Erica’s lust-filled eyes, Rylie licked her lips. She slowly opened her robe and let it fall down. Max and Erica watched as she caressed her body, sliding her hands over her breasts and down her hips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What if, um,” She hesitated, then spoke quickly, before she lost her nerve. “I want to do more than just touch myself?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What do you want to do, Ry?” Erica asked, breathlessly, breasts bouncing in time with Max’s movements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I want to join in!” Rylie felt her face flush, but there was no stopping now. “I got &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt; turned on, watching you all day.” She looked back and forth between Erica and Max, still not entirely sure who she meant. “But I can’t just watch anymore.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Oh, yes,” Erica exhaled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Fuck yeah,” Max growled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rylie dropped to her hands and knees and crawled forward. Erica moaned as their lips met. The upside-down kiss was filled with heat. Erica sucked on her bottom lip, and Rylie pushed her tongue between her lips. Then Max thrust forward energetically, shoving Erica back and breaking the kiss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She made a disappointed sound followed by a surprised gasp as Rylie started kissing down her neck. She crawled forward, over Erica’s body, lips dancing toward her breasts. Eagerly, she wrapped her lips around Erica’s nipple, flicking her tongue against the stiff bud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Erica moaned and squirmed as Max continued fucking her, and Rylie released one nipple to move to the other. Her breasts were hanging in Erica’s face, who reached up to cup and squeeze them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rylie shivered as Erica trapped her nipples between her fingers, rolling and pulling. She released Erica’s with a wet pop and glanced up at Max. He looked like he couldn’t believe his luck. He continued thrusting into Erica, but his eyes were locked on Rylie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Erica gasped as Rylie continued crawling forward, kissing down Erica’s body. She shivered with delight as Rylie’s lips brushed over her stomach, inching ever lower.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rylie was tingling with excitement as she moved closer and closer to where Max’s cock was disappearing between Erica’s lips. She found herself panting with lust at the sight of Erica creaming around his shaft. Unable to draw it out any longer, she lunged forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Erica squealed as Rylie ran her tongue over her clit and along Max’s cock. The angle was awkward. She had to turn her head to keep from getting jostled out of the way as Max continued fucking Erica. He tried to lean back a bit, to change the angle and make it easier for her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rylie eagerly lapped up the cream around the base of his cock, then teased her tongue over and around Erica’s lips, wanting more. Max groaned, and Erica squealed when Rylie’s tongue flicked against her clit. They quickly found a groove, with Rylie excitedly licking them both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then it was Rylie’s turn to gasp, as she felt Erica’s fingers exploring her pussy. She groaned, and wrapped her hand around the base of Max’s cock, slick in her grasp as he plunged in and out. When Erica slipped a couple of fingers inside, Rylie pulled Max out on the backstroke, and guided him between her lips instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Oh fuck!” Max exclaimed as he unexpectedly found himself in the heat of her mouth. He didn’t slow down or calm his thrusting. If anything, he seemed to pick up the pace, trying to push deeper. Rylie moaned, feeling Erica’s fingers twisting inside, and tried to relax her throat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Max shouted in triumph as he grabbed a handful of Rylie’s hair and pushed into her throat. She swallowed, trying not to gag, wanting to take him all the way. Erica lifted her head and wrapped her lips around Rylie’s clit, sucking as her fingers curled. Stars flared at the edges of her vision. All day, she’d been watching them fuck each other, and now they were both fucking her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gasping and sputtering, Rylie was finally forced to push Max away, guiding him back into Erica, who cried out at suddenly being filled again. He frantically resumed fucking her, Rylie gasping at the sight of Erica’s pussy swallowing his throbbing cock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She finally realized what she wanted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Max,” she panted. “Will you fuck me?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Fuck,” he grunted. “You know I’ve always wanted to!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Okay, but you can’t cum inside me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Where do you want me to cum?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I want you to fuck me until you’re about to explode, then &lt;em&gt;use&lt;/em&gt; Erica’s mouth.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Oh!” Erica squealed from between her thighs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quickly, they changed positions, so Rylie was lying on her back with her legs spread. Max wasted no time, immediately burying his throbbing cock inside her. His thickness spread her open and filled her completely. She cried out at the overwhelming sensation. As he started fucking her, she felt her walls squeezing and gripping him tightly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Holy fuck, Rylie,” Max moaned. “I don’t think I’m gonna last long!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Wait!” She begged, rubbing her clit. “Let me cum first!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Erica was kneeling to one side, watching with awe in her eyes. She had one hand between her thighs and the other was roughly tugging on her nipple. Rylie made eye contact with her, and she moaned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Erica, you’re so sexy,” Rylie gasped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Rylie!” Erica rocked in place, shamelessly masturbating for her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pressure in her core was growing quickly. Max’s cock seemed to stimulate everywhere at once. Waves of sensation rippled from her pussy, tingling along her spine, and sparking at the edge of her vision. Her clit thrummed under her fingers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Oh fuck,” she moaned, feeling the pressure build. “Max, keep fucking me! I’m gonna cum!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Max dug his fingers into her thighs, and thrust with increased fervor. Her core tensed, and she felt a gush of release as her pussy clenched around his cock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Erica,” he grunted, trying to hold back. “Come here, I need you!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Yeah!” She nearly threw herself forward, lying on her side, and resting her head on Rylie’s pelvis. Max thrust furiously, and Rylie felt his cock twitch, then begin throbbing. Erica opened her lips as Max pulled out of Rylie and buried himself in her mouth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Cumming!” He grunted, holding her head in place as he continued thrusting, fucking her mouth. “I’m cumming!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rylie’s own orgasm was still rippling as she watched Max use Erica for his pleasure. She moaned happily, swallowing and squirming, with a hand clamped between her thighs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Holy fuck,” Rylie gasped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a long moment, Max shuddered and pulled out of Erica’s mouth with a wet slurp. He staggered backwards to collapse into the armchair. His erection was finally beginning to soften.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Erica shifted around until she could lay her head on Rylie’s shoulder. She hummed to herself in a satisfied way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rylie laughed, and pulled Erica closer, hugging her tightly. She giggled and threw a leg over Rylie’s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Erica, I…” Rylie trailed off. There was something important to say, but wasn’t sure how. Had she crossed a line? Was Erica okay? Did she feel the same attraction Rylie could no longer deny?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Shhh,” she responded. “Everything’s fine, Ry. Relax.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What about Max?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The fuckboy?” Erica laughed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Hey, I heard that,” Max protested groggily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You love it,” Erica teased.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I just,” Rylie worried, “I think I…”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We can talk about it later.” Erica’s lips met hers in a soft kiss. “Because of you, I’m not going anywhere, remember?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Okay.” Rylie blinked, then slowly grinned as the tension bled away, replaced by a warm glow in her chest as Erica snuggled closer. “Yeah.”&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A hot new book from Ruby Pink!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Go Ask Your Girlfriend!&lt;/em&gt;, author Ruby Pink brings you four steamy short stories about women who know what they want. “Meet Me in the Supply Closet” is about an illicit encounter in the office that isn’t what it first appears to be. “Whoops, Wrong Number” tells the story of a woman whose unintentionally seductive text turns into a memorable exchange. “Rainy Day at the Shop” is about two bored employees finding a way to entertain them selves on a slow day. And in the titular “Go Ask Your Girlfriend,” Heather agrees to teach Jimmy a few things about women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ruby Pink loves reading erotica but was frustrated to find so many featuring shallow women with no agency. She took up the pen to bring us steamy shorts about real women who aren’t just props in male fantasies.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;It was four in the morning, and I was incredibly turned on. The room was dimly illuminated by starlight and the glowing green numbers on the alarm clock. I could hear rain spattering the window and the soft snores of a half-dozen of our friends. His hand was on my hip, and I could feel his warm breath on the back of my neck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few hours ago, our group was ordering a final round at the bar. He and I had flirted before, but for some reason, tonight the spark ignited into a bonfire. We couldn’t take our eyes off each other. We sat side-by-side in a booth, perhaps a little closer than we needed to. I pressed my leg against his. He whispered jokes in my ear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The party migrated to the studio apartment he shared with his roommate. Although their place was tiny, it was a conveniently close to the bar. Despite the short walk, we all got a bit wet in the rain. He loaned me a dry t-shirt, and when I peeled off my wet top in the bathroom, I left my bra hanging on the towel bar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We sat together on his bed, smoked some weed and listened to some music. The vibe grew more chill. Everyone found a spot to settle on the floor or the little couch they’d managed to squeeze between two beds, dressers, and desks. I leaned against him as his roommate put on a movie, too distracted by the way he caressed my arm to pay much attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One by one, everyone else dozed off. When he finally turned off the TV, the room was plunged into darkness. We both shuffled out of our jeans, and climbed under his blanket by touch. There’s not much space on a twin bed, but we didn’t mind. He lay behind me, with one warm hand on my hip. His breath on the back of my neck sent shivers down my spine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Very slowly, he slid his hand down my thigh and back up. I leaned back against him invitingly. He started kissing my neck, and I’m not sure if I’ve ever been more aroused. When he lightly nibbled my earlobe, I squirmed, and his bed let out a warning creak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We have to be quiet,” he breathed in my ear. I could only inhale shakily in reply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He moved his other arm awkwardly, below my head and over my shoulder, to cup my breast. My nipple tightened under his palm, and I wished I had thought to take my shirt off, too. I slowly shifted against him, gratified to feel a growing firmness against my rear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I reached behind me to grab his ass, though he needed no encouragement, and we could get no closer. His fingers teased along the waistband of my panties, and when he slipped under, I let out a breath I hadn’t realized I’d been holding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As quietly as I could, I moved my leg over his, spreading my thighs as he reached lower. His fingertips brushed over my trimmed hair, and my heart pounded with anticipation. When he discovered how wet I was, he squeezed my breast eagerly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I stifled a gasp as he pushed a long finger inside. We squirmed together as slowly as we could, trying to avoid the bed making any noise. His rapidly hardening cock throbbed, nestled between my cheeks. I turned my head, desperate to find his mouth. The angle wasn’t quite right to kiss, but we tried.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I rolled my hips as he added another finger. He thrust against me a bit too enthusiastically, and the bed frame creaked. We froze momentarily as someone made a noise in their sleep, but his fingers never stopped working their magic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I reached between our bodies and pushed my hand into his boxers. He let out a shuddering breath as I wrapped my fingers around him, squeezing and pulling. His shaft was swollen, and when I teased my fingertips along the sensitive ridge of his head, he shuddered and bit my shoulder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way his fingers curled put pressure on my clit, which thrummed at his touch. I wanted badly to hump against his hand, to satisfy the growing need in my core. Instead, I bit my lip to avoid making any sound and rocked my hips as much as I dared. From the way he throbbed in my hand, I could tell he was struggling to hold back, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually, I couldn’t take it anymore. As slowly as I could manage, I rolled over to face him. Our lips met with passion, subdued only by the need to avoid making noise. He pulled his fingers out and reached around to squeeze my ass as I wrapped both hands around his cock. I bit his lower lip as he thrust into my grip. He twitched, and I felt precum lubricate my palm. I eagerly rubbed it into his skin. His breathing was ragged when I finally broke our kiss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He let me push him slowly onto his back, and I climbed on top, wincing with every creak of the mattress. I raised my shirt and shifted forward. He wasted no time taking my breasts in hand and wrapping his lips around my nipple. I shivered and bit my tongue to avoid crying out as his tongue swirled, sending sparks through my nervous system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He squirmed below me as I shifted my weight. I was barely able to stifle a gasp as his tip prodded me. He lifted his hips to grind against me, excited by the contact. There was a growing need inside me, but I didn’t know if I could give into it without waking everyone in the room. With my breast in his mouth and his cock mashing against me, I could only rock in place, trying not to moan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All I wanted to do was shift our underwear out of the way and let him bury himself inside. God, it would feel so good. Just the thought sent a series of fluttering sensations through me. He thrust harder, as if hoping he could somehow tear through the thin fabric separating us. The mattress creaked ominously, and he squeezed my breasts hard enough to make me gasp. I rocked against him, shivering with desire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abruptly, he released my nipple. He looked up at me, pleading, begging for more. He was getting close, I could tell. I held a finger to my lips. He nodded. Slowly, I scooted down between his legs. He watched with wide eyes as I tugged down his boxers to free his erection. I had soaked right through my underwear and his. He bit his lip as I ran my tongue up his shaft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I wrapped my lips around his head, he pulled the pillow over his face to avoid making any noise. In the heat of my mouth, he twitched against my tongue. The only thing in the world I wanted at that moment was to make him cum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I sucked hard, gripping the base of his shaft. With my other hand, I cupped his balls and teased my fingernail against the sensitive skin below. His legs stiffened, and his head swelled in my mouth. I barely managed not to moan as he lifted his hips to thrust deeper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I felt him tap my shoulder and realized he was trying to warn me. Happily, I swirled my tongue faster, moving my hands, willing him to do it. His balls tightened, and I felt his shaft pulse right before his cum started filling my mouth. I was unable to avoid letting out a satisfied moan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I milked the final spurts from his throbbing cock, he shuddered and pulled away from my lips, overwhelmed. I swallowed, savoring how hard I’d made him cum, and slowly crawled back up into his arms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As my heart rate slowed, and I calmed down enough to think about anything besides the heat of our bodies, I whispered in his ear:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“My apartment next time.”&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://rubypinkromance.com/images/queen-of-marketing-1uVW4aEZit-512w.jpeg&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Christy was livid. She paced back and forth in her office, replaying the events of the meeting in her mind. Fucking James. He’d always been an insufferable prick, but now he was putting her team at risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pausing by the window, she tried to allow the familiar view of downtown to calm her. Dark clouds rolled overhead. Neon signs and streetlights reflected in the wet streets. Cars slowly crossed the bridge. She could be heading home, too, if it weren’t for him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week, Frank, the CEO, asked the department heads to prepare a twenty percent budget cut across the board. At first, she’d been concerned, but her plan was solid. A reduction to the Marketing team’s ad spend, some cost-cutting, and a few layoffs. Going into the meeting today, she’d felt confident.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One by one, they’d gone around the table and somberly delivered proposals. Sales. Human Resources. Operations. No one wanted to let people go, but they all recognized the necessity. When Frank called on Marketing, she’d proudly done her duty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then he turned to James and asked for the Engineering team’s plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Can’t do it, Frank,” he said shamelessly. “I’m already short-staffed and underfunded. Engineering’s a finely tuned engine. I can’t just start cutting, it’ll fall apart.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The room fell silent. The other department heads looked shocked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“James, come on,” Frank sighed. “No one’s happy about it, but this is serious.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Hey, I get it.” He raised his hands helplessly. “But this is a &lt;em&gt;product&lt;/em&gt; company. No devs, no product.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Be realistic, man. What’s your proposal?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Take it from Marketing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All eyes turned to Christy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carl, the VP of Sales—a thick-necked man in an ill-fitting suit—stifled a laugh. James grinned at him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Is this a joke to you?” She frowned. Carl had the decency to look chastened, but James just crossed his arms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“No joke,” he said. “Your department’s always been overfunded. Find some more fat to trim.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We already cut twenty percent, which puts our metrics at risk. Your team has the largest budget of the company by far!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Engineering has the largest budget for a reason. I need staff to build all the new features you put in ads without consulting me!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our campaigns are drawn up months in advance! You decline every meeting invite, then have the nerve to say you weren’t consulted?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Oh, &lt;em&gt;here&lt;/em&gt; we go. The ‘Queen of Marketing’ assumes everyone should be at her beck and call!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“My title,” Christy growled, “is vice president. It shouldn’t be hard to remember, it’s the same as yours.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s not the same!” James scoffed. “I’m the VP of &lt;em&gt;Engineering&lt;/em&gt;. Without my team, the company folds. Without &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; team…”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is a budget crisis, you can’t just refuse to…”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If &lt;em&gt;your highness&lt;/em&gt; would ever care to descend from the seventeenth floor, you’d see my devs struggling with outdated equipment, facing ridiculous demands…”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That’s &lt;em&gt;enough&lt;/em&gt;!” Frank threw up his hands in frustration. “I can’t listen to this anymore.” He pinched the bridge of his nose. “It’s been a long day, and I’m exhausted. You two, stay. Everybody else, go home.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James and Christy glared at each other as the other department heads filed out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You will work together,” Frank said, raising a hand to cut off their objections, “and bring me a budget for &lt;em&gt;both&lt;/em&gt; your teams that meets the overall reduction goal. I don’t care if it takes all night. Have it on my desk in the morning.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Fine,” James snarled. “I’ll be in my office. It’s on the third floor, in case your highness has forgotten where the &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; work gets done.” He stormed out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Frank, you can’t be serious,” she protested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I know James can be difficult. But we need him.” He clapped her on the shoulder. “I also know you have a real knack for problem-solving. I trust you’ll find a way to resolve this.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An hour later, she was glaring out the window in her office. Typical. Succeeding as a woman meant having to do your job twice as well as the men, and for a reward, you got to do their jobs, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How the hell was she going to get James to do his part? There was no reasoning with someone so convinced of his superiority. He’d never admit he was wrong because he couldn’t handle the humiliation. He’d dig in until someone forced him to change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her eyes flicked to the garment bag hanging on the coat rack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Someone with more confidence and power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She unzipped the bag, and ran a fingernail over the black leather.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Someone who could show him how pathetic he really was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Come in,” James called when she knocked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She stepped in, closing the door behind her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What’s with the long coat?” He sneered. “You ready to head home? Gonna give up and admit I was right?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Hardly,” she responded, looking around his office disapprovingly. It was decorated like a dorm room. Shelves of tech gear of all sorts. Posters and printouts of comics plastered on the walls, peppered with nerdy stickers. Everything about the space was designed to make non-geeks feel out of place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In that case, welcome to where the magic happens.” His office chair was one of those ridiculous gamer chairs, red leather with cupholders and a headrest. “Have a seat,” he added, gesturing to an ugly couch that looked like he’d dragged it in off the street.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You humiliated me today, you know.” She said it calmly, hands in her coat pockets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Well, if the Queen can’t hack it in the boardroom, that’s just another reason to cut your team.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Hmm,” she nodded slowly. “I thought you’d say something like that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She turned to his windows, facing the warren of cubicles that filled the rest of the floor. Despite the hour, there were still several devs out there. As she walked through, they were all playing video games or browsing social media. No one looked up as she closed the blinds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James looked confused when she locked the door, but before he could say something snarky, she opened her coat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His jaw dropped as he took in what she was wearing. Glossy black heels. Thigh-highs and garters paired with a mesh thong. Long black gloves that ended above the elbow. Her black leather corset left her breasts exposed, including a metal bar pierced through each nipple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You see, James, I know your type.” Ignoring his dumbfounded expression, she calmly draped her coat over a trolley filled with monitors. “A &lt;em&gt;small&lt;/em&gt; man who gets off on lording his knowledge over others.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She sauntered around his desk, allowing her hips to sway, punctuating her words. He swiveled to face her, eyes wide as she stood over him. “You play your petty games and throw your childish tantrums because you believe you are better than your peers.” It was hard to say if he was more shocked by her outfit, or the way she carried herself while wearing it. “You assume the rules don’t apply to you.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“No, I—I, uh, that is…” He abruptly stood up and backed away from her, desperate to regain control of the situation, but unable to think straight. She followed him around the desk until he collapsed onto the couch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You think you are special,” she sneered, putting her foot against his crotch. “But when push comes to shove,” she pressed down hard, as if grinding out a cigarette butt, “you’ll collapse at my feet.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Ah, fuck!” He whimpered pathetically, too overwhelmed to resist. “Your heel… That hurts!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Do you want me to stop?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Yes! Shit!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What do you say?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Please!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She relaxed the pressure just a bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When you speak, you’ll address me properly. Use my title.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Vice president!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Hmm,” she considered. “No, not here. In this context, I think you know what you should call me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Q—Queen?” He looked afraid to say it, fearing a trap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Yes.” She took her foot away. “That’s fitting.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What, um, what do you want?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She narrowed her eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Queen! What do you want, um, Queen?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Better.” She turned her back and walked to his office chair. She grimaced as she sat down. It was stupidly uncomfortable, but claiming his throne was a message so clear even he would understand. “Start by taking off your clothes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He looked surprised. Before he could get the wrong idea, she gestured dismissively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Don’t get excited, I have no interest in your pathetic body or flaccid prick. You simply haven’t earned the right to wear clothes around me yet.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Yet? Uh, Queen?” He quickly removed his tie, dropped his clothes in the corner, and stood awkwardly in front of her, covering himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Yes. From now on, anytime I’m forced to be in your presence, unless other people are around, you will remain nude. Now, stop trying to cover yourself and kneel.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He swallowed nervously, and lowered himself to his knees. His cock twitched nervously, still soft, but threatening to grow. She refrained from smiling at just how quickly he’d surrendered total control to her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her heart was pounding. He had no way of knowing, but this was the first time she’d ever acted on this fantasy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She had a ritual. Before every department head meeting, she locked her office door and changed into this outfit. Then she masturbated while imagining the men kneeling and worshipping her. It gave her a secret, and more than once a man had backed down from a conflict, unable to face the odd confidence in her eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not James, of course. He’d always been oblivious. But now here he was, groveling before her for real! The rush of power left her practically breathless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You may remove my heels,” she announced, as though she were bestowing a great privilege upon him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He slipped them off and moved as though to toss them aside as carelessly as he’d discarded his clothing. But seeing her expression, he set them to one side with more reverence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Good. Open your mouth.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He hesitated a moment before parting his lips. Slowly, deliberately, she raised her nylon-covered foot. He looked pathetic as she rubbed it against his face, before finally pushing her toes into his mouth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Now, &lt;em&gt;suck&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He frowned, but wrapped his lips around her big toe. It was awkward around the nylon, but she pushed deeper. He gagged a little, but swirled his tongue dutifully. His obedience caused a surge of heat between her thighs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fucking hell, she loved telling him what to do. Not wanting to get too worked up too quickly, she withdrew her toes. He scowled and looked away, flushed with humiliation as he wiped the drool from his mouth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before he could react, she leaned forward and slapped him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Wipe that scowl off your face! I’m doing you a favor. By rights, I should &lt;em&gt;destroy&lt;/em&gt; you. Do you realize how easily I could convince Frank to finally cut your worthless ass loose and hire a real man to replace you? After a few calls to my network, you’d be toxic. No one would hire you again.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He rubbed his cheek, trying to determine if her threat was genuine. She allowed him to see the steel in her eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You’ve &lt;em&gt;badly&lt;/em&gt; misread the situation here. You saw me as a weak-willed little woman to push around. Now, you understand the truth. You continue to have a role here only because I choose to allow it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She saw the final spark of defiance die inside him. It sent a thrill down her spine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I think there’s something you should say, don’t you, James?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Um,” he stammered. “Th—Thank you, Queen.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Hmm. I’ll say this, you’re a quick learner.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He nodded, suddenly eager to please.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Okay,” she purred, leaning back and spreading her thighs. “You may continue.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sight of him kissing his way up her legs was deeply arousing. She hissed with pleasure as she pulled on the bars in her nipples. His lips reached the top of her thigh-highs, brushing against her bare skin. Eagerly, she pulled her thong to one side, and spread her lips for him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He paused at the sight of her bare pussy, dripping with excitement. He glanced up at her, and she nodded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Do it,” she commanded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He closed his eyes and lowered his face between her thighs. She bit her lip as he ran his tongue along the length of her. Timidly, he explored, barely dipping between her lips. He traced her folds and contours, hesitantly prodding, either unable or unwilling to commit fully. She growled with frustration as he circled her opening again and again without ever entering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Don’t waste my time,” she warned, grabbing a fistful of his hair and mashing his face more firmly against her. He yelped in surprise, but finally, she felt him push inward. “Yes, like that,” she murmured, “deeper.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heart pounding, she rested her feet on his back, startled by how turned on she was. He wasn’t particularly skilled, but the power dynamic itself made her insides clench. She tugged harder on his hair, demanding more. He let out surprised little moans every time she squeezed around his tongue. She rubbed his nose against her clit, using his face like a toy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Don’t stop,” she groaned, “don’t you dare stop.” He gasped wetly for breath, but she continued fucking his face. He grabbed her thighs, and she swatted his hands away. So many times, she’d imagined the sneering men in her life groveling at her feet, begging for the privilege of servicing her. Now it was happening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She felt an orgasm approaching. It was absurd. She hated him. Found everything about his personality repugnant. But the way he submitted to her, allowed her to use him for her pleasure, left her quivering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her core clenched, and he sputtered as she gushed in his mouth. She kept her grip on his hair, forcing him to swallow. She groaned loudly enough to wonder if his staff could hear. He continued to work his tongue until she finally had to push him away when it became too much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He rocked back, gasping for breath. She squeezed her thighs shut around her hand, pressing against her clit as aftershocks rippled through her core. He stared at her, awestruck, her wetness glistening on his chin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She was so overwhelmed by the situation that it took her a long moment to realize he was frantically stroking his cock. Clearly, she wasn’t the only one turned on by his submission. His cockhead was swollen, and so dark red it was nearly purple. He stared wantonly at her as he masturbated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What. The fuck. Do you think? You’re doing.” She sat up and glared at him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He startled, glancing down at his swollen prick, as if he hadn’t realized he was touching it. Quickly, he let go, and looked up at her with the same expression as a dog caught digging through the trash. His cock still throbbed desperately. As she watched, a large drop of precum leaked from the tip and fell to the floor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Did I give you permission to touch yourself?” She got to her feet, adjusting her underwear back into place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“No, Queen!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Then why are you rubbing your sad excuse for a cock at me?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m sorry, Queen, I… I just… I didn’t think…”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That’s right, you didn’t think. You never do.” She glowered at him, hands on her hips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He looked absurd. The hangdog expression on his face was completely at odds with the eager twitching of his cock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m not here for your sexual gratification, you fucking worm! You are &lt;em&gt;beneath&lt;/em&gt; me. Unworthy of me. If you so much as have a wet dream about me, you’d better wake up and beg forgiveness!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Yes, Queen!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If you’re unable to control yourself in the future, you’ll need to be restrained. Is that clear?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Yes, Queen.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She put her foot on his shoulder and forcefully pushed him backward until he lay on his back on the rough carpet. It looked uncomfortable, but his erection still jutted hopefully upward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I think you’ve forgotten that I have a job to do.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He looked up at her, utterly bewildered. Her domination was so complete that he’d forgotten the reason she’d come to his office in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The budget, James.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Oh! Right… Queen?” A reminder of their professional roles while lying nude on the floor was clearly confusing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“How much can Engineering cut?” As she asked, she put her foot on his cock. It throbbed eagerly, mistaking the stimulation as sexual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I… I can’t… We need—ah!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He cried out as she pressed down hard. It twitched once, and another squirt of precum drooled out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Fifteen—oh god!—Fifteen percent, Queen?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That’s a good start, James, but I think you can do better.” She ground her heel mercilessly against the base of his cock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Twenty! Twenty percent, Queen!” He groaned and squirmed, clawing at the carpet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That’s good, James, I’m glad we could reach… Oh, for fuck’s sake!” As soon as she removed her foot, his cock started spraying cum all over his stomach. He whimpered and writhed as he climaxed uncontrollably.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You really are fucking worthless, aren’t you?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Yes,” he panted. “Yes, Queen,”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shaking her head, she stepped into her heels, and put on her coat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Clean yourself up. I expect your budget proposal before you go home tonight.”&lt;/p&gt;
