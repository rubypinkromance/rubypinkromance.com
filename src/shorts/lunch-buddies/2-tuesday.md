Ash wasn’t surprised when Tony texted the next day asking if she wanted to get lunch again.

They’d had a very nice time together. He paid for her food with his per diem. They chatted about college. He gave her a polite hug, the kind you’d give to an old friend you were just seeing briefly while you were in town. He said goodbye as if he wouldn’t see her again anytime soon. She smiled, kissed him on the cheek, and didn’t believe it for a second.

And now here he was again in her doorway, holding his bag in front of himself and looking nervous.

“Hey there, stranger,” she smiled, “Come on in.”

“Thanks, I, uh…” He stepped in, and gestured uncertainly at the door, closing it behind him when she nodded. “My other lunch plans fell through, and I wasn’t sure if you had plans of your own…”

“Hey, Tony,” she cut him off.

“Yeah?”

“Do you want to put your bag down?”

“Oh, uh, sure.” He dropped his bag by the wall and stood awkwardly, not covering the erection tenting his pants, but not fully confident of her reaction, either. “So, you know, like I said, my lunch plans fell through…”

She crossed her legs and raised an eyebrow at him.

“And, uh…” He looked flustered. “It was so great to see you…”

She sighed. “It was great to see me?”

“Yes?” He was confused.

“Come on, Tony.”

“What? I…” he stammered.

“When did you get this timid?”

“Timid?” He frowned. “I’m just trying to be polite.”

“Alright, look, sit down,” she said, gesturing at the couch. “Do you remember yesterday you were telling me how exciting it was in college to go back to my dorm between classes? How I’d act like I was doing you a favor, and then I’d get into it? And knowing that I was into it made it hotter?”

He nodded.

“The part you’re leaving out, or maybe forgetting, is that _you_ were into it too. Like, I knew what was going to happen every time I invited you up. You weren’t pushy about it. You weren’t a dick. I knew I could draw a line and you’d respect it. You were eager. You were _enthusiastic_ about anything we did. That’s what excited me.”

“That makes sense,” he agreed.

“But now you come in here all hesitant, dancing around the point, acting like you just happened to find yourself free, and wouldn’t it be nice to get lunch again?” She laughed. “Fuck, I bet you were about to try some line like ‘Oh, I couldn’t stop thinking about you last night.’”

“No, I…”

“No? Maybe you were hoping that I’d lick my lips and stick out my tits and tell you _I_ couldn’t stop thinking about _you_ last night?”

“Ash, fuck, I’m sorry if I misread the situation…”

“Because I couldn’t.”

“Wait, what?”

“I went to bed and tossed and turned and couldn’t stop thinking about you. About you masturbating in my office. About the hunger in your eyes when I touched myself for you. It was fucking electric. When I finally pulled out my vibrator, I came _so_ hard.”

“Really?”

“Really.” She laughed. “I had to get a towel.”

“Wow.”

“Yeah, wow.” She leaned back and smiled at him. “And now you walk in here with this,” she gestured dismissively, “soft romantic bullshit. Well, I’m sorry, but that’s not why I said yes when you texted.”

“Okay,” he laughed. “How can I make it up to you?”

“Why don’t you start by telling me why you really texted me.”

“Alright, I can do that. There’s this girl at the office. Cute. Red hair. After a meeting, she was picking up some papers that fell on the ground and I could see down her top. She was wearing a red bra.”

“That’s all it took?”

“No. She had kinda small boobs, and as she leaned further down, the cup of her bra kinda pushed out, and I caught a glimpse of her pierced nipple.”

“Hmm, interesting. Was she flirting with you?”

“No, I think she was genuinely unaware. I tried not to stare, and she picked up the papers and walked away.”

“But it was too late for you.”

“Oh yeah. I had to sit there for a while. And even after I managed to stop thinking about her nipples, I started thinking about yours.” Unconsciously, his hand drifted to his lap, rubbing against his cock.

“And that’s when you texted me?”

“Yeah. It seemed like we had fun yesterday, and I was hoping you’d, uh,” he hesitated.

“Say it.”

“I was hoping you’d help me out again.”

“Try again,” she encouraged.

“I was hoping you’d show me your nipples and let me jerk off to you again.”

“That’s more like it,” she purred. “See, all you had to do was ask. Now why don’t you show me how hard you are.”

Tony undid his belt, opened his pants, and shifted them a bit lower. His cock jutted proudly upward, head swollen, eager to be touched. He wrapped his hand around the shaft and started slowly stroking.

“Can I see your tits?”

Smiling, she slowly pulled her top open. She felt pleased with herself that she’d thought to wear a wrap top and soft lace bralette that could be easily moved out of the way without having to take her whole top off.

He exhaled happily as she massaged her breasts. When she teased her nipples, he quickened his stroke. She savored his attention and the effect she was having on him. The heat growing between her thighs seemed to match the intensity of his gaze.

Slowly, she spread her legs for him. She teased her skirt a bit higher, enough to let him see that her underwear matched her bra. He watched eagerly as she ran her hands up the inside of her thighs and back down.

“Ash,” he suddenly said in a husky voice, “Will you let me suck on your nipples?”

“Oh!” She laughed. “Look who’s comfortable asking for things all of a sudden!”

“You said you wanted me to be more direct.”

“I did, didn’t I?” She stood up and bit her lip as she moved closer.

She couldn’t deny the excitement she felt as she knelt next to him on the couch. She reached out, sliding one hand behind his shoulder, along the back of the couch. He kept touching himself as she leaned in, putting her breasts right next to his face.

“Go ahead,” she said, and gasped as he wrapped his lips around her nipple. He moaned happily, pulling more of her into the heat of his mouth, tracing his tongue in circles. The sensation seemed to shiver through her body, dancing down her spine.

“Oh, that’s good,” she exhaled as he flicked his tongue. She squirmed, squeezing her thighs together, watching as he continued to masturbate. Clearly, he was enjoying this. She saw a drop of precum glisten for a moment before he rubbed it into his skin. She bit her lip as she imagined licking it up.

He released her nipple with a wet pop and she shifted closer so he could suck on the other one. Now more of her body was pressed against him, and she could feel his arm moving against her stomach. She wanted to feel more. Without quite realizing she was doing it, she swung her leg over his and straddled his thigh. With her body pressed against him like this, he couldn’t move his hand as much, but she didn’t mind slowing him down for a moment.

Sensing what she needed, he shifted his leg, lifting it a bit to press more firmly against her, while still licking and sucking. He squirmed, trying to adjust so he could move his hand more freely. She moaned and rolled her hips, rubbing against his thigh.

“You feel so good between my legs,” she murmured. “Keep going, keep going.” There seemed to be lightning arcing between her nipple in his mouth and the pressure against her clit. She buried her face in his hair and leaned harder against him, straddling his thigh, grinding, his arm straining between them, her tits out, nipples hard, pressure building…

“Fuck!” He grunted around her nipple. “Ash, please, I’m close, let me finish…”

With some reluctance, she rolled off his thigh and lay back on the couch next to him. She held her breasts, firm pressure covering her sensitive nipples. His hand was flying frantically on his cock. She squeezed her thighs together, wanting more, but fighting the urge to climb back on top of him, because she wanted to watch him finish.

“Oh fuck that was so hot, you’re so sexy when you ride me like that, and let me suck on your tits while you grind on me…” He was babbling and his head was swelling, large and purple, and smeared with precum. She bit her lip and stared, eager to see thick globs of hot, creamy cum coating his fingers.

Suddenly he was groping for the tissue box. “Ash! I’m gonna cum.”

“No, I want to see,” she protested, reaching for him. “Come here!”

“Where?” He was already rolling toward her.

“Cum on my tits!”

Clumsily, he got onto his knees, still stroking, and thrust his hips forward just in time for the first shot to arc up onto her neck and collarbone. She gasped at the sensation of hot cum on her skin. Then he groaned, and pointed his cock towards her tits, each spurt falling across her chest, until he was rubbing the tip against her breast, milking the last drops directly onto her nipple.

“Fuck, that was hot,” she purred as he collapsed onto his back next to her. He was still breathing too heavily to answer, but he nodded emphatically.

Idly, she traced a fingertip through the sticky fluid already cooling on her chest. The heat in her core was beginning to fade, but she knew the embers of her arousal would continue smoldering. It would be a long afternoon of meetings until she could finally go home, get in bed, and replay the image of him about to cum all over her again and again.

“Hey Ash,” he murmured.

“Hmmm?”

“Can I see you again tomorrow?”

“You better,” she grinned.
