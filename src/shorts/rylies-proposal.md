“I just wanna get fucked!” Erica blurted.

Riley choked and struggled not to spit out her drink.

“No, not just fucked, I wanna get _used_!” Her roommate gesticulated drunkenly, spilling her drink on the kitchen floor. “I want a guy to look at me like all he can think about is bending me over, and, and, like, pulling my hair, and screwing the shit out of me! You know what I mean?”

“Yeah,” Rylie laughed. “I know what you mean.”

She had come home to find Erica in tears on the couch. She’d been laid off, and had no idea how she was going to find the money for tuition and rent. Rylie got them some drinks, and did her best to reassure her that things would work out somehow. She’d only intended to help her relax a bit, but had apparently overdone it and landed in drunken confession territory.

Rylie liked Erica. She was a good roommate. Easy to get along with. Always paid her bills on time, and did her share of the chores.

However, if pushed, Rylie might have admitted that she thought Erica was just a bit uptight. She dressed conservatively. She didn’t smoke weed. She preferred studying to partying. She’d never once brought home a random guy from the club. Or from anywhere, for that matter.

Which made her aggressive pantomiming and declaration that she wanted someone to “fuck every hole until she couldn’t walk straight” a bit shocking.

“Erica, I’ve never seen this side of you,” Rylie chuckled.

“Oh, my older brothers are fuck-ups, so I’ve always been under all this pressure to be the perfect good girl and graduate and do a good job and not ruin my life by getting pregnant or doing drugs or ever having any fun ever.” The words gushed out of her like a burst dam.

“You know, I think you might need some food,” Rylie said, putting a pot on the stove to make some noodles.

“No, what I _need_ is to get wrecked by a big fucking cock.” She heaved a sigh and drained what was left of her drink.

Rylie nodded understandingly, and replaced her glass with water.

“I’m so jealous of you, Ry. You do what you want, how you want. And _who_ you want! I always meant to ask you to help me with guys, but there were finals and work and stuff. And now I’m gonna have to go back home and live with my mom and get some shitty retail job, and, and, and…” She trailed off, sniffling and blinking away tears.

“Hey now, no more of that,” Rylie said, giving her a quick hug while fetching sauce from the fridge. “No one’s moving home. I told you, we’ll figure something out. Then we’ll go dancing, and I’d love to be your wingwoman.”

“There’s nothing to figure out, it’s too much money,” she gestured dismissively. “Just promise me you’ll get me laid before I leave. Like, _proper_ laid.”

Rylie bit her lip as she stirred the sauce into the noodles. She wasn’t sure if what she was about to say was a good idea or not. Despite Erica’s proclamations, it might be a bridge too far for her.

“Erica, you’re not a virgin, are you?”

“No! I’ve done it before. It’s just, you know, been a while. And the guys I have been with? They were sweet and caring and, um…”

“Kinda boring?”

“Yes!”

“Okay.” She took a deep breath. “What if I could solve both of your problems at the same time?”

“What are you talking about?”

“You remember my friend Max?”

“The fuckboy?” Erica responded, then clapped her hand over her mouth, horrified at what she’d said.

“It’s alright,” Rylie laughed, “he _is_ a fuckboy. Total trust fund kid with no idea how the real world works, and an overinflated ego.”

“So why do you hang out with him?”

“He’s fun.” Rylie shrugged, dividing the noodles into two bowls. “He likes to party, and _loves_ being the center of attention. We get into the cool clubs, go to wild places, and meet outrageous people.”

Erica took the offered bowl and started eating. Rylie sat down across from her.

“And, there is one other reason.” She hesitated long enough for Erica to look up from her noodles. “Sometimes… he pays me.”

“Why does he…” Erica frowned, then opened her eyes wide in realization.

“It’s not what you think,” Rylie blurted. “He just pays me to act like his girlfriend.”

“Do you have sex with him?”

“No! Well, kinda?” Rylie blushed. “I only go down on him.” Confessing this to Erica was more awkward than she’d expected. “I told him if he wanted to pay to fuck someone, he could go find a proper escort.”

Erica raised an eyebrow.

“Look, the point is, Max has more money than sense. Early on, he made it clear he likes spending time with me, and would be willing to pay me enough to make up for any work I’d miss if he wants to go party for a weekend or whatever. And then some. We have fun together, and I make some extra cash at the same time.”

“And the sex?” To Rylie’s relief, Erica sounded more curious than horrified.

“When we get back to wherever we’re staying, he likes to watch me masturbate.”

“Then you give him head?”

“Yeah. I don’t mind after I’m turned on.”

“Huh.” Rylie considered this for a moment. “Wait, you said you had a way to solve my problems, then you brought up Max?”

“I know, I know, just hear me out! You want to get properly fucked, right? Well, for all his flaws, Max actually has a pretty nice cock. He’s clean, he’s always respected my boundaries, and I know he’s interested in you.”

“He is?” Erica seemed more shocked by this revelation than anything else.

“Oh yeah. He’s told me before that you could join us anytime. I assumed you wouldn’t be interested in that kind of thing.”

“Um, how much money are we talking about?”

“Enough to cover your tuition and a few months of rent.”

“Holy shit, really?”

“Really,” Rylie nodded. “What do you think?”

“Fuck it.” Erica grinned. “Two birds with one stone. And I won’t have to move home with Mom! Call Max, tell him I’m in.”

**A Few Days Later**

“Where _is_ he?” Erica asked again, pacing back and forth. “I thought you said he’d be here at lunch? It’s almost three!”

“He said, ‘around lunch,’” Rylie answered from the couch. “Max has never been on time to anything in his life.”

When Rylie had called Max and explained the situation, he’d enthusiastically agreed, and said he’d pick them up on Friday. Now it was Friday, and Erica was a ball of nerves.

“Are you sure this isn’t too short on me?” She fretted, tugging at the hem of the skirt she’d borrowed.

“It’s not, but even if it was, the whole point is to get you ‘properly fucked,’ remember?”

Erica grimaced, hearing her own words quoted back to her. Rylie stood up and squeezed her shoulders.

“E, are you sure you’re still into this? It’s not too late for me to call Max and tell him to fuck off.”

“No, no, I mean, it’s fine, I just hate waiting.”

As if on cue, there was a knock at the door. Rylie gave Erica a quick hug, and let Max in.

“Ladies! Sorry I’m late, I had lunch with some cryptocurrency guys, and they would _not_ stop talking. You know how it is. How ya doing, Rylie?” He gave them both a quick hug, then dropped onto the couch, exhaling noisily. “Whew! Alright, Erica, come here, sit with me. Let’s chat.”

She glanced at Rylie, who nodded, then sat down next to Max. Rylie leaned against the wall, curious to see how Max would handle this.

“I was fucking _stoked_ when Rylie told me what you’re looking for. You couldn’t have known it, but your timing was perfect. I’ve been sitting on something kinda special, waiting for the right opportunity, and babe, I think it’s for you. Here’s the deal. I’ve got this pill I ordered from a Russian catalog. A buddy tried it, said it’s like hurricane-force Viagra. This little beauty is supposed to let me fuck like a goddamn stallion all day and night.”

Erica blushed, but didn’t stop him.

“Now, you know that Rylie and I have an arrangement. We usually just do a bit of partying, a bit of dancing, then she gives me head. We keep it kinda softcore. Girlfriend experience, you know? I throw her a bit of walking-around money because I was tired of her saying she couldn’t go out because she had to work. So now she can have a good time with me, no worries. And that’s great, I love it, but like you, I am craving that next-level experience. I wanna rock it _hardcore_, have a day that we’re both gonna remember when we’re old and gray, you feel me?”

She nodded, as if this was a perfectly reasonable thing to say.

“Cool cool cool. Rylie told me you were looking for a good time, but I get that this is probably gonna be outside your comfort zone. Now, I don’t want you to think I’m paying you to do anything you don’t want to do. I’m gonna push your limits, sure, but what I’m spending my money on is an _experience_, one that I think we’re both gonna savor.”

“Plus,” Rylie interjected, “I’ll be there the whole time to make sure you’re okay. If it’s too much at any point, you just let me know.”

“Right,” Max nodded emphatically. “So, here’s my dream, and I think this magic pill’s gonna make it happen for us. We’re gonna go out, we’re gonna have a good time. We’re gonna dance, we’re gonna party, and I’m gonna fuck you every hour on the hour.”

“Every hour?” Erica hesitated.

“Every hour,” Max nodded, glancing at his watch. “For twelve hours. So what’s it gonna be, babe? Are you in or out?”

“Um,” She slowly nodded her head. “Yeah. Yeah, I’m in. Let’s do it.”

“Whoo! That’s great fucking news, ’cause I took the pill on the drive over here, that short skirt of yours is driving me crazy, and I’m already hard as a motherfucker!” He looked at his watch, and held up one finger. “Okay, the clock staaarts… now!” A timer chimed, and he quickly unbuttoned his pants to free his cock. True to his word, it looked almost painfully erect.

“Oh!” Erica gasped.

“Come on, babe, we’ll start slow. For now, just go down on me.” He rubbed her shoulder encouragingly, pulling her closer as his cock twitched.

She glanced at Rylie, clearly a bit hesitant to do it in front of her. Rylie gave her a wink and a thumbs-up.

“Oh yeah,” Max groaned, closing his eyes as she lowered her head and wrapped her lips around him. “This pill’s got me really goddamn sensitive!”

Rylie bit her lip, fascinated by the sight of her uptight roommate bobbing her head in Max’s lap.

“Jesus, your mouth is so hot! It feels amazing!” Erica made a surprised sound as Max put his hand on the back of her neck, encouraging her to go lower. “Keep going! I’m not gonna last long.”

Rylie was surprised at how aroused she felt from the sight of Max using Erica’s mouth for his pleasure.

“Oh fuck! Fuck yeah,” Max grunted as Erica slurped loudly around his cock. “I’m getting close!”

He opened his eyes and looked straight at Rylie as he pushed harder on the back of Erica’s head. She didn’t protest, just moaned in response and swallowed him deeper.

“Your throat,” Max gasped, as Rylie squirmed in sympathy, “so fucking tight!” Erica’s lips finally reached the base of his cock, making him groan loudly. “Fuck! I’m gonna cum!”

Erica gripped the edge of the couch cushion tightly as Max started shaking. He grunted with each spasm, still holding her head down as he shot his load into her throat. She moaned, eyes watering, trying to swallow everything.

At last, he gasped and let go, collapsing back and panting. Erica popped up immediately, coughing and choking, wiping his cum from her lips. She looked at Rylie with surprise.

“You okay?” Rylie mouthed.

Erica nodded, tears running down her cheek, but grinning widely.

“Holy shit,” Max crowed as he buttoned up his pants. “This is gonna be _sick!_ Okay, ladies, we got a flight to catch. Tonight, I’m taking you to my buddy’s club in LA. Grab your stuff, real quick-like. Rylie, bring that little red number I bought you last month? Erica, we got just enough time to go buy you something sexy to wear.”

“Seriously?” Rylie asked. “You’ve got twelve hours, and you want to spend a bunch of them on a plane?”

“It’ll all balance out with the time zone change,” Max shrugged, unconcerned. “Hustle up!”

**4 P.M.**

An hour later, Rylie was sitting with Max on the bench outside a changing room. Erica was inside trying on a handful of dresses. The saleswoman had been a bit rude until Max had flashed his credit card. Suddenly, she’d been more than willing to help Erica, who seemed a bit overwhelmed by the fancy shop, pick out a few things.

“How’s this one? Is it too much?” Erica pulled back the curtain a bit timidly. She’d had to remove her bra, and the loose purple fabric plunged daringly from her shoulders, exposing quite a bit of pale skin.

“Whoo!” Rylie grinned. “Your tits look great. Can you dance in it?”

Erica hesitated, then lifted her arms to sway to an imaginary beat. The dress barely clung to her curves, and started to shift away from her breasts. She squealed and pulled it back into place.

“It’s good.” Max nodded appreciatively. “Do you like this one or the green one better?”

“Um,” she considered, “I think the green one would be better for dancing?”

“Done deal.” He nodded, glancing at his watch. “But, uh, don’t take that one off just yet.” He stood up and put an arm around her waist, pulling her into the changing room. As the timer beeped again, he winked at Rylie and closed the curtain.

Erica squealed in mock protest. The saleswoman looked up at the noise and narrowed her eyes when she noticed Max was missing. Rylie shrugged in a “what are you gonna do” kind of way. The saleswoman sighed and busied herself with neatening the already well-organized displays.

Rylie grinned and turned her attention to the curtain. It wasn’t quite closed all the way, and from where she sat, she could see a narrow view of Erica and Max’s reflections in the mirror. Erica had dropped to her knees, allowing the dress to fall down her arms, exposing her breasts, which she was pushing together around Max’s cock. He was whispering something while thrusting urgently into her cleavage.

She looked flushed, with a mixture of arousal and concern on her face, no doubt worried they’d get caught. Max clearly didn’t care about anything except the way her tits felt around his shaft.

Rylie crossed her legs, once again surprised at how erotic she found the sight of them together.

Erica was awkwardly leaning forward, trying to lick the tip of his cock at the peak of each thrust. Max grimaced as her tongue teased him and said something Rylie couldn’t hear. Erica looked up at him, eyes wide, as he shoved her back against the wall and fucked against her chest harder.

Abruptly, he stiffened, and Erica let out a surprised sound as thick white cum splattered her chest. It shot across her collarbone and fell across her breasts. She eagerly leaned down to wrap her lips around him, sucking and swallowing the last of his climax as his spunk dripped down her nipples onto the purple fabric.

He stepped backward, and walked calmly, if a little winded, from the dressing room. The saleswoman frowned and pretended not to notice him buttoning his pants as he approached the counter.

“She’ll take the green one,” he announced. “And the purple one, too. We, uh, spilled something on it.”

**5 P.M.**

Max drove like a bat out of hell to get them to the private jet terminal at the airport in time for their flight.

“Not like they’d leave without us,” Max laughed dismissively, “but I got a schedule to keep.”

The plane was small but luxurious. The cabin had just four seats, all facing each other, more than like recliners than airliner seats. The flight attendant got them all seated, and disappeared into a small galley area as the plane took off. After reaching altitude, she reappeared with glasses of champagne.

Rylie sat across from Max and Erica, sipping her drink and curious to see what Max would do at the top of the hour. Erica seemed intrigued as well, but Max just grinned and made small talk until the timer on his watch went off.

“Erica,” he grinned, obviously pleased with himself. “Want to join the mile-high club?”

“What, you mean in there?” She shot a hesitant look toward the restroom door.

“No, babe, right here.”

“Here?” Erica looked apprehensive. “What if the flight attendant comes back?”

“She won’t. Passengers on flights like this value their privacy.”

“Um,” she hesitated, shooting a nervous glance at Rylie. “Okay. Yeah. Uh, how do you want to…”

“I want you to come ride my cock.” Without waiting, he lowered his pants to around his ankles. His cock jutted upward, already hard and eagerly twitching.

“Oh!” Erica grinned and reached under her skirt to slip off her panties, then moved to straddle him in the oversized seat.

Rylie bit her lip as she watched Erica wiggle her hips, imagining the way she was positioning Max at her entrance.

Max grinned as Erica slowly lowered herself, one hand on his shoulder, the other between her legs. Her skirt was draped over them, blocking Rylie’s view, but she could tell the moment he filled her from the way Erica shivered.

Slowly, she started moving on top of him, lifting and lowering herself. She gasped every time he slid home. From behind, Rylie couldn’t see her expression, but the tilt of her head and the way she squirmed told her everything she needed to know.

After a few minutes of slow, sensual build-up, Max’s hands appeared on her waist.

“This is nice and all, but I want you to _ride_ me!”

Erica squealed as he pushed her forcefully down onto him. He squeezed her hips tightly, tugging her up and slamming her down over and over. She cried out every time he thrust upward to meet her.

“Yeah, like that,” he groaned, “fuck me hard!”

“Oh my god!” Erica moaned.

Rylie squirmed. The cabin smelled like sex, and hearing the wet sounds of their fucking was almost more erotic than if she could see Max’s cock plowing into Erica.

“Fuck!” Max grunted. “Your pussy! Feels so good!”

“Yes!” Erica cried over and over. “Yes, yes, yes…”

“I’m gonna fuck this pussy all night long!”

“Yes, fuck me,” she moaned. “Use me! Oh god, use me!”

“I’m cumming!” He groaned, slamming her down one last time and holding her in place with white knuckles.

“Ah!” She grasped the headrest of his seat as he shuddered between her thighs.

After a long minute, he let her go. She quickly got to her feet and ran to the bathroom, hand between her legs.

“Holy shit,” he grinned, lazily stroking his cock, which glistened with Erica’s juices. “This is fucking incredible. I gotta get more of these pills.”

Rylie didn’t say anything. Her jeans suddenly seemed very tight.

**6 P.M.**

A few glasses of champagne later, Erica was laughing as Rylie and Max shared a story about a night clubbing when Max’s timer went off again.

Erica set her glass aside and looked expectantly at Max, who was already unbuttoning his pants. As before, his cock sprang forth, erect and ready to go.

Once again, he had Erica sit in his lap and ride him, gripping her hips tightly and fucking her against him until she was moaning with every thrust.

Rylie watched, and hoped it wasn’t obvious how turned on she was. She hadn’t really considered what effect it would have on her to watch them fuck over and over again.

Erica seemed overwhelmed, wordlessly groaning and gasping as he took full advantage of her body. Rylie hoped the experience was living up to her fantasy.

Max stared lustily at Erica’s bouncing tits, not caring at all that Rylie was there. If anything, it seemed to excite him to have an audience.

At last, he came inside her again, cursing triumphantly the entire time. Erica threw her head back and gasped at the sensation, before climbing shakily to her feet and stumbling to the restroom.

This time, Rylie followed her, slipping into the tiny room with her.

Erica looked surprised, but quickly sat on the toilet to wipe up the cum leaking out of her.

“Are you doing okay?” Rylie asked, worried she’d gotten her friend in over her head.

“Okay?” Erica laughed shakily. “God, I’m fucking dripping! The idea that he’s just going to keep taking me like this all night? Using my body for his pleasure? It’s incredible.”

“Are you sure? It kinda seems like… a lot.”

“I’m good, Ry, I promise.” She stood up and pulled her into a hug.

**7 P.M.**

“We’ll be landing soon,” Max said, the next time his watch beeped. “Get on your knees. I wanna fuck you from behind.”

“Where?” Erica looked around for a good spot.

“Right here,” Max said, gesturing at the floor between their seats and Rylie’s. The seats were big, but the cabin wasn’t, and there wasn’t enough space between the seats for what Max had in mind without practically doing it in Rylie’s lap.

“But,” Erica protested.

“Rylie can switch seats if she wants,” Max said, with a grin. “Or she can stay there. I think she’s enjoying watching us fuck, and wouldn’t mind a closer view.”

Rylie fought back a blush at Max’s observation, and focused on Erica, trying to read how she felt about this suggestion. She looked surprised, Rylie thought, but not opposed to the idea.

“E, I told you I’d be here the whole time, to make sure you’re okay. But if you want, I can move.”

“No,” Erica gulped, dropping to her knees. “You should stay here! To, um, keep an eye on things…”

“Awesome,” Max grinned.

They got in position. There was just enough room for Max to kneel behind her, practically with his butt still in the seat. Rylie had to spread her legs to let Erica brace herself on her seat.

Erica looked up at Rylie with wide eyes as Max lifted her skirt and rubbed the head of his cock against her. She opened her mouth to say something, but before she could, Max thrust forward, burying himself completely. She groaned, mouth wide, as he started fucking her.

Rylie could no longer pretend the situation wasn’t turning her on. Erica swaying between her thighs with every thrust. Max grinning like a wolf, knew full well the effect this was having on her.

He slapped Erica’s ass, making her squeal and grab Rylie’s leg. He fucked her harder, pushing forward with more force, shoving her closer to Rylie, who was gripping the armrest tightly. The lust in Erica’s eyes, gazing up at her and squeezing her leg, caused an intense heat to blossom in her core.

“Rylie,” she gasped, “He’s so deep!”

“Yeah,” Rylie breathed, unable to form a more coherent thought.

Max groaned loudly, fucking her relentlessly.

“I, oh!” Erica moaned. “I think, ah, I think I’m gonna cum!”

“Fuck yeah,” Max growled. “Me too!”

“Oh!” Erica gasped again. “Oh my god!”

She dropped her head onto Rylie’s hip and dug her fingernails into her thigh. She groaned loudly, sending a wave of sensation through Rylie, who struggled to contain herself as Max continued fucking Erica against her.

Abruptly he cried out, staring wild-eyed and rocking with each pulse of his orgasm. Rylie shuddered as he and Erica came together, practically in her lap.

**8 P.M.**

“I know this incredible Korean fusion place. You ladies are gonna love it,” Max exclaimed as he sped down the street, weaving in and out of traffic in the Mustang he’d had waiting for them.

The restaurant turned out to be a confusing blend of styles. The decor was old-school high-class dining, with tablecloths, fancy chairs, and candles. The dim lighting barely concealed that the restaurant had been through multiple styles and cuisines as the owner jumped from trend to trend. Despite that, the dining room was crowded.

The head waiter recognized Max and escorted them to a reserved table in the back corner. Max sat with his back to the wall as the waiter gave them menus.

The food turned out to be quite good, though Rylie was a bit distracted by Erica’s nervousness. Her eyes kept darting to the clock on the wall, ticking closer and closer to the top of the hour. She scanned around the dining room, unsure what Max would suggest. Surely, he wasn’t planning to fuck her over the table in front of everyone?

When his timer finally beeped, Erica was practically vibrating with anticipation. He calmly reached down to unbutton his pants. Rylie glanced around the dining room, but their position in the back meant no one noticed he’d just pulled out his throbbing erection. He grinned at Erica and gestured with his eyes for her to go under the table.

Her cheeks flushed, but she licked her lips. After looking around to make sure no one was watching, she quickly ducked under the tablecloth.

Rylie couldn’t believe it. The tablecloth wasn’t very long, but the dim lighting meant anyone not looking carefully could easily miss the sight of Erica crouching under the table. And while the wet sounds of her increasingly enthusiastic blowjob seemed painfully obvious to Rylie, the music was apparently loud enough to keep anyone from noticing.

“What do you think of your—ah—kimchi tacos?” Max asked, as if his cock wasn’t in someone’s mouth.

Rylie didn’t bother answering. She felt flushed, and took a sip of water. Why was this so exciting? Her heart was pounding. She wasn’t even really involved, but sitting here while it happened, _knowing_ it was happening, made her feel like she was part of it.

Max shivered in response to some unseen stimulus. He gripped the edge of the table tightly and laughed in surprise. He scooted so low in his chair that Rylie worried he might fall out.

“How is everything?” The waiter appeared suddenly. “Would you like any dessert?” Max could only shake his head, with a screwed-up expression on his face. The waiter looked momentarily concerned, but Rylie assured him the food was excellent, and they would not be having dessert. “Very good. And the other young lady?”

“She, um, stepped away to powder her nose.”

The waiter nodded, and moved on to another table, politely ignoring whatever was going on with Max.

“Oh, fuck me,” he groaned quietly as soon as the waiter was out of earshot. “I started cumming just as he walked up!”

Rylie bit her lip and watched as Max squirmed. She imagined Erica under the table, lips wrapped around his throbbing cock, milking the last of his orgasm. Suddenly, he shuddered and sat up straight, breathing heavily.

A moment later, Erica reappeared, climbing quickly back into her seat.

“Holy shit,” Max laughed giddily as she took a drink of water. “You are amazing. This is the best money I’ve ever spent!”

Erica blushed furiously, but looked pleased.

**9 P.M.**

“There’s no point showing up to the club before midnight,” Max declared as he drove to the hotel. “We’ll get checked in here and kill a bit of time.”

Predictably, the suite was ostentatious. It was larger than their apartment. Hell, it was larger than her parent’s house. It had multiple rooms, a chandelier, a fireplace, and a jaw-dropping view of downtown L.A.

They were all standing on the balcony when Max’s watch beeped. Rylie watched, amused, as he kicked off his pants, stepped behind Erica, and lifted her skirt. She spread her legs and arched her back as he gripped his swollen prick and angled it to meet her.

“Oh!” She gasped as he slipped easily inside. Apparently, she wasn’t exaggerating about how wet the situation made her.

Max wasted no time, grabbing her hips and thrusting eagerly. Erica braced herself on the chest-height glass railing. Rylie couldn’t help but notice that she was pushing back to meet him on every thrust.

Biting her lip and trying to ignore the insistent heat between her thighs, Rylie turned her gaze outward. There was another hotel across the street, and she scanned the windows idly. In one room, a family was putting their kids to sleep. In another, a man lay in bed watching TV.

And in one room, almost directly across from them, a woman wearing expensive lingerie stood at the window. She stretched languidly as a nude man appeared from behind and kissed her neck.

Rylie was distracted from the sight when Erica swore loudly. Max had grabbed her hair and yanked her head back, making her cry out with a mix of pleasure and pain.

When Rylie looked back across the street, she was surprised to see the couple looking in their direction. The woman tapped the man and pointed. He followed her gesture and smiled when he spotted the three of them on the balcony. He said something in the woman’s ear that made her laugh, and caressed her body as they watched.

“Hey Erica,” Rylie said, “you’ve got an audience.”

“What?” Erica groaned. “What do you mean?” She opened her eyes and followed Rylie’s finger, pointing to the couple across the way.

“Oh my god!” She squealed. “They’re watching us?”

“Awesome!” Max looked over her shoulder, saw the other couple, and laughed. He tugged Erica’s hair harder, forcing her more upright, and continued fucking her.

“Max,” Erica moaned, “They can see us!”

“Yeah,” he agreed. “It’s hot, right?”

“Oh god,” she moaned. “Oh fuck!”

Rylie tried not to squirm as she discreetly squeezed her thighs together. Watching Erica give in to lust was turning her on more than she wanted to admit.

“Get ready,” Max growled, “I’m close.”

“Will you—ah!” Erica struggled to ask, “cum on my face?”

“You want them to see me cum on you?”

“Yes! Oh fuck, yes, cum all over me!”

“Get on your knees!”

Rylie and the couple across the street stared as Erica dropped in front of Max. He stroked his cock, pointing it at her lips. She panted with desire, one hand under her skirt, shamelessly rubbing her clit. She gasped as hot cum splashed across her face.

“Stand up, babe, show them how sexy you look.”

Erica climbed shakily to her feet, and turned to face the couple across the way. They grinned and waved. She waved back, laughing deliriously.

**10 P.M.**

An hour later, the three of them were sprawled across the enormous bed in the master suite. Erica had washed her face while Max ordered some fruit to snack on and Rylie watched a baking competition on the obscenely large television.

Max hadn’t bothered to put his pants back on after cleaning up, so Rylie could see that even after cumming, the pill kept him hard. He lounged on the bed between them, legs spread, cock resting on his stomach, faintly throbbing with his heartbeat. He noticed her looking, and winked. His cock twitched eagerly, as if pleased by her attention. She rolled her eyes and turned back to the TV, pretending she hadn’t felt an answering flutter inside.

When his timer went off, Erica put down her grapes and sat up eagerly to see what he wanted her to do. She’d discarded her bra and top, and her nipples looked almost as stiff as Max’s cock.

He stood up and walked to the foot of the bed, turning to face them. Erica followed on her hands and knees, and enthusiastically wrapped her lips around his head. He laced his fingers in her hair, and she moaned as he pushed deeper into her mouth.

Rylie sat awkwardly against the headboard. The heat between her thighs was impossible to deny. She bit her knuckle and stared, trying to resist the urge to pinch her nipples or shove a hand down her pants. It was confusing. She was just here to make sure Max didn’t get out of line. Being used for someone else’s pleasure was Erica’s fantasy, not hers. So why was she so turned on?

“Rylie,” Max said, snapping her out of a haze.

“Huh? Nothing. What?” She crossed her arms over her chest.

“It’s okay,” he grinned, still thrusting into Erica’s mouth.

“What’s okay?” She was genuinely confused, and distracted by Erica’s quiet moans.

“I can tell this is turning you on. Why don’t you touch yourself?”

“I, um, no, I mean…” She found it difficult to answer, distracted by the sight of Erica’s lips finally reaching the base of his shaft. He groaned and held her there for a long moment until she started choking. Eyes watering, she quickly turned around on her hands and knees so he could fuck her from behind.

“Come on—ah!” He gasped as Erica slipped him inside. “You masturbate for me all the time. Why is this different?”

“I… I mean, it’s…” Rylie stammered, unable to take her eyes off Erica’s face as Max started fucking her.

“Rylie,” Erica whimpered, “please…”

“Oh fuck,” she groaned, unable to resist any longer. Erica and Max watched hungrily as she peeled her clothes off. She squeezed her breasts, nipples puckering eagerly with the long-denied stimulation.

“Watch this, Erica,” Max murmured. “She’s so fucking hot when she gets off.”

Erica could only moan in agreement as Rylie leaned back and spread her legs. Her lips were already puffy and sensitive, and she gasped as she spread her wetness with her fingers. Max grinned, the way he always did when she started rubbing circles around her clit.

“Did it turn you on, watching us all day?”

Rylie groaned, unable to deny it, but reluctant to say so.

“I knew it!” He laughed. “On the balcony, I thought for sure you were gonna rub one out while they watched us fuck!”

“I almost did,” she breathed, picking up the pace. “It turned me on so much.”

“Back at your apartment, I could tell you were shocked when I made her suck my cock, but you never looked away.”

“I couldn’t,” she admitted, then tried to make an excuse. “I had to make sure you didn’t overdo it.”

“That’s not why, though,” he laughed. “Come on!”

“It was hotter than I thought,” she conceded, “watching the two of you.” She groaned as she pushed two fingers inside, while continuing to rub her clit.

“Then on the plane, when I fucked her into your lap, I thought you were either gonna kiss her or make her eat you out!”

Erica let out a squeal, and looked up at Rylie with startled longing.

“Max, shut the fuck up,” Rylie moaned, feeling the pressure building. Erica was staring, grasping at the blanket as Max started fucking her harder, slamming into her from behind. Rylie’s insides were starting to clench around her fingers.

Erica came first. She slapped the bed and screamed, burying her face in the blanket, shaking uncontrollably. Max kept his grip on her hips, holding her up as he fucked her, relentlessly working toward his climax.

Rylie grunted as all her muscles seemed to contract at once. She felt a hot gush around her fingers as waves of pleasure radiated from her core. This orgasm had been building all day, and the release was nearly overwhelming. Her entire body seemed to be pulsing, clenching, thrumming.

The sight of Rylie cumming pushed Max over the edge. He groaned and shoved Erica down onto her stomach with one final thrust, collapsing on top of her. She moaned happily as he came inside her.

Rylie kept her palm clamped over her clit, legs shaking and head swimming with confusing thoughts about both Max and Erica.

**11 P.M.**

Like everything else in the hotel room, the shower was absurdly large. The tiled space could easily accommodate multiple people. There were several rainfall shower heads mounted to the ceiling, and a surprising array of pleasant-smelling body washes.

“Jesus, this feels amazing,” Erica purred, standing under one of the shower heads and letting the water cascade down her back.

“Right?” Rylie grinned. “A girl could get used to this.”

Rylie had been pleasantly surprised when Erica followed her, giggling, into the steamy spray. There was little trace remaining of her shy, uptight roommate. This new Erica was reveling in her newly claimed sexuality, and after letting Rylie watch her get fucked repeatedly, sharing a shower was apparently no big deal.

“I, um…” Rylie started to ask something and then changed her mind. “Just to be clear, are you still doing okay with all this?”

“I’m more than okay!” Erica laughed, “Oh my god, this is, like, _revelatory_. I’ll need to process a bit at some point, but, yeah, it’s everything I wanted. Thank you so much for setting this up.”

“Good, good.” Rylie rolled her neck. She meant to ask about the way Erica looked at her on the bed, and on the plane. But she wasn’t quite sure of her own feelings. It was complicated because Max was involved. Or was it? Maybe she was overthinking it.

Before she could work out what to say, a now-familiar beeping sound announced Max as he strolled erection-first into the bathroom. Erica squealed excitedly as he joined them in the shower.

Rylie quickly rinsed off as Max turned Erica around, pushed her up against the wall, and shoved his cock between her legs. She gasped and arched her back, angling to meet him as he started fucking her hard and fast.

Retreating to dry her hair in the next room, still confusingly aroused, Rylie turned up the TV to cover the sound of Erica’s moans.

**Midnight**

At last, Max decided it was time to head to the club.

“Never show up early, ladies. Like the bard said, the party don’t start ’till we walk in.”

“That’s a line from a Kesha song, you dork.”

“What can I say, I love the classics. Let’s get dressed!”

After they changed into their dresses, Max tossed his keys to Rylie.

“Wanna drive?”

“The Mustang?” She grinned. “Hell yeah.”

The car was stupidly fun to drive. The motor growled like a beast waiting to be let off the leash. At a red light, a car pulled up alongside, low-slung, with neon lights underneath, revving a challenge. Max and Erica laughed from the back seat as she gunned it, effortlessly leaping ahead of the other car when the light turned green. She was having so much fun, she barely noticed Max’s watch was beeping again.

“Max!” Erica giggled. “My dress!”

“Just pull it up and sit in my lap, babe,” he replied.

Glancing in the rearview, she caught a glimpse of Erica straddling Max, with her dress hitched up over her hips.

“You guys better be quick,” Rylie laughed. “We’re almost there!”

“Just—ah—park in the back,” Max groaned, slightly muffled by Erica’s cleavage. “We’ll use the VIP entrance.”

As she pulled into a small parking lot, an attendant with a clipboard gestured for her to stop and roll down the window.

“Name?” He asked, sounding bored.

“Um, Max?” Rylie said, trying to sound like someone who used VIP entrances all the time.

“Not on the list,” he replied after a quick scan.

Rylie was surprised to hear Max’s window rolling down. Erica squealed as the attendant looked in, but Max kept a firm grip on her hips and didn’t let her move away.

“I’ve got a standing invite,” he groaned, encouraging Erica to keep moving. “Text Stevie and—ah—tell him Max flew in for the night.”

The attendant barely raised an eyebrow at the sight of them fucking in the back seat. Rylie wondered what kind of things he saw regularly in this job to leave him so nonplussed. He pulled out his phone and started typing.

Erica, after the initial moment of surprise, seemed to decide she didn’t mind an audience and resumed bouncing enthusiastically on Max’s cock. Her moans of pleasure did get a bit more performative, Rylie couldn’t help but notice.

“Alright,” the attendant finally replied, ignoring Erica. “He says you’re on the list. You can park over there.” He walked away, casually gesturing to a space between two other expensive cars.

“Are you,” Erica gasped as Rylie parked. “Are you—oh!—gonna cum soon?”

“Yeah,” Max growled. “You want it in your mouth or your pussy?”

Rylie turned around in her seat to watch, curious what Erica would decide.

“Oh fuck!” Erica seemed unsure. “I—ah!—You…”

“Choose quick!” Max groaned, his eyes screwed shut as he tried to hold back.

“My mouth,” Erica squealed. She jumped off him just as his cock started throbbing, and wrapped her lips tightly around his head. She moaned happily as she swallowed, stroking his shaft.

Rylie unconsciously squeezed her breasts at the sight. Max’s eyes were screwed shut, and he rocked in place, unaware of anything beyond the pleasure of cumming in the heat of Erica’s mouth.

Finally, he collapsed. Erica quickly opened the car door and climbed out, wiping her chin and shimmying her dress back down over her hips.

“Max, hurry up,” she laughed. “I wanna dance!”

**1 A.M.**

For the next hour, Erica commanded the dance floor. Rylie was genuinely impressed. Her dancing was uninhibited, as if she was celebrating a new perspective on life. People seemed to orbit her, sometimes swinging closer, sometimes peeling off, burned by flying too close to the sun.

Rylie stayed close, at times dancing with Erica, or moving back when she seemed to vibe with someone. Mostly men would cruise by, hoping to get close to Erica. Occasionally, she would let them. Their hands would roam over her hips, or wrap around her back, trying to pull her in, but they seemed unable to keep ahold of her, and she would move on to a new partner.

Several women came in as well. One moved in time with the beat, standing behind Erica, hands exploring her sides. Another joined her from the front, their legs twined together as they moved in time. Rylie felt her heart beating faster as the women caressed Erica’s body, grinding with her to the pounding beat. But when one leaned in as if to kiss her, Erica slipped away, finding Max in the crowd.

Max seemed to instinctively understand that any attempt to constrain Erica or keep her to himself would backfire. He enthusiastically danced nearby, matching her energy, with an effortless confidence that came from knowing he would claim her again.

As if sensing Rylie’s thoughts, Max glanced down at his watch, and showed it to Erica, who allowed him to lead her from the dance floor. On the way, he caught Rylie’s eye and gestured toward the bathrooms. With a shared sense of excitement, they moved through the crowd together.

Erica didn’t hesitate to pull Max into an open stall in the women’s room. Rylie took a spot at the counter near other women checking their makeup and gossiping. A few eyebrows were raised when they went in the stall together, but it was clearly a common enough occurrence.

A moment later, there was a thump against the door, followed by the sound of Erica moaning. With every passing moment, she got louder, and more of the girls started laughing, or openly staring at the stall door, thumping against the flimsy frame so hard it looked like it might crash open.

Once again, Rylie was struck by the change in her roommate. If you had told her the day before that Erica would be getting loudly fucked in a public restroom at a club, she would have laughed. It was completely out of character.

“Fuck!” Erica screamed as the thumping got faster. “Fuck me harder!”

Rylie wished she had followed them into the stall. It was a dumb thought, there’d be no room for her, but she wanted to see the look on Erica’s face. She imagined a gleam of excitement in her eyes, genuine lust mixed with the thrill of performing in public.

Max let out a loud groan, there was one last final slam against the door.

A few moments later, the stall opened and Erica walked out, adjusting her dress. She was blushing, but looked pleased with herself. Several of the women applauded.

Max followed in her wake, tossing off a casual wink at the catcalls he received as they returned to the dance floor.

**2 A.M.**

Later, after more drinking and dancing, Max escorted Rylie and Erica back out the VIP entrance. The night air felt cool compared to the packed club.

“That was so much fun!” Erica said, spinning giddily as they crossed the parking lot. “Why are we leaving?”

“It’s last call in a few minutes,” Max explained. “The club’ll clear out after that, and I’m a big believer in leaving a party before it winds down.”

They were a few steps from the exit when Max’s timer went off. They all stopped for a moment and looked at each other, then Erica ran the last few steps to the car.

“Come on, we can do it in the back seat again!”

Rylie nodded and opened the driver’s door, but stopped to look when Erica squealed. She was bent over, starting to climb into the car, but Max had grabbed her hips from behind, holding her in the open door. He started lifting her dress.

“Max!” She laughed and swatted at him, but he kept going, pulling it up to expose the fact that she had no panties on. “Here in the parking lot?”

“I said every hour on the hour, babe. I’m not waiting to feel your hot little pussy around my cock again.” He quickly unbuttoned his pants. Rylie couldn’t tell if she was imagining that his cock looked even more swollen than earlier.

“Okay, but—OH!” Erica barked in surprise as Max filled her with one eager thrust. “Oh fuck, we’re outside! Uh! Anyone—ah!—could see!”

“There’s no one to see except a bartender having a smoke,” Max groaned.

“Oh my god!” Erica moaned. “Is he watching? Ah! Is he watching you fuck me?”

Rylie glanced around. There was indeed a dude in a tight black shirt smoking near the door. It was a small parking lot, and they were only a couple car lengths away. He could clearly see them from where he was standing.

“Yeah, he’s watching,” Max growled. “He’s into it, too. After we finish, I bet he’s gonna go jerk off.”

Erica slapped the seat and moaned at the thought.

Rylie glanced in the direction of the bartender, who, despite Max’s description, seemed only mildly curious. She climbed into the driver’s seat, closed the door, and adjusted the rearview mirror so she could see the back seat. Erica’s tits were threatening to fall out of her top with each thrust.

Quickly, Rylie hitched up her own dress, pushed her panties to one side and ran a finger through the wetness coating her lips. She watched Erica moaning and swaying, gripping the edge of the seat. Max was barely visible, urgently fucking her through the open door.

Rylie slipped one finger inside as Erica’s top finally lost the battle, and her breasts spilled out. Her lips were parted, eyes wide with lust, but unfocused. Rylie imagined climbing into the back seat with her. She couldn’t tell if she wanted to kiss Erica, suck on her nipples, or push her out of the way and take her place.

Max groaned loudly and gave her ass a slap, making Erica cry out in surprise. Rylie pushed another finger inside. She remembered being on the plane as Max fucked Erica into her lap. Imagined that she had spread her legs, and made Erica go down on her. She rubbed her clit, imagining it was Erica’s tongue, with Max grinning and thrusting harder, as if he was using Erica to fuck Rylie.

“I’m gonna cum,” Max groaned. “I’m gonna flood your fucking pussy…”

“Oh!” Erica cried out. “Oh fuck! Yes!”

Rylie bit her lip and fucked herself in time with Max’s thrusts until he grunted, pushing deep inside and holding there. Erica moaned long and low, whimpering as Max came deep inside. Rylie felt her insides clenching around her fingers and imagined it was her bent over in the back seat instead of Erica.

**3 A.M.**

For Rylie, the next hour passed in a haze of sexual tension.

Erica cuddled with her on the bed, idly flipping channels on the television. Once they’d returned to the hotel room, she and Rylie had both shed their club clothes, and put on a pair of soft hotel bathrobes.

Erica didn’t seem anxious anymore. Somewhere in the course of the day, she’d given herself over fully to the experience. The waiting, the not knowing what Max was going to do to her next, it was all part of it. She fairly radiated satisfaction.

Max lounged in an armchair, scrolling on his phone. The only sign that he wasn’t completely chill was the constant nervous tapping of his foot. His twelve hours were nearly up. He had one more turn with Erica, and Rylie figured he was trying to think of a way to make it count.

Rylie’s head was still swimming with confused arousal. She was extremely aware of the heat of Erica’s body, snuggled against hers. Spending the entire day watching the two of them fuck had left her flooded with lust. She still wasn’t sure if it was mostly aimed at Max or Erica.

When Max’s timer went off, he stood up, stretched, and quickly undressed. Standing at the foot of the bed, his cock jutted upward, swollen with need. Erica quickly shucked her robe and crawled, nude, towards him.

“What do you want to do, Max?” She purred seductively.

“Lay on your back, babe, I want to watch your face while I fuck you.”

She giggled and lay down, spreading her legs invitingly. Max stepped forward, and rubbed the head of his cock between her lips.

Rylie got to her knees so she could see better. Instinctively, she held her robe closed.

They all watched him push slowly inside, drawing a moan from Erica as her lips parted around him.

“Fuck,” he exhaled. “Your pussy is so hot!”

“Oh!” Erica gasped, as he lifted her ankles to his shoulders, and slipped deeper inside. “Yes! Your cock fills me up so good.”

Rylie reached inside her robe, squeezing her breast and feeling the nipple tighten under her palm.

Slowly, Max started moving his hips. Erica laid her head back, eyes closed. Her hands moved restlessly over the blanket, gripping it every time he pushed inside.

“How about it, Rylie,” Max asked, “wanna touch yourself again? It turns me on to watch you rub your clit while I fuck your friend in front of you.” Erica moaned at this, and opened her eyes to see what Rylie would do.

Looking in Erica’s lust-filled eyes, Rylie licked her lips. She slowly opened her robe and let it fall down. Max and Erica watched as she caressed her body, sliding her hands over her breasts and down her hips.

“What if, um,” She hesitated, then spoke quickly, before she lost her nerve. “I want to do more than just touch myself?”

“What do you want to do, Ry?” Erica asked, breathlessly, breasts bouncing in time with Max’s movements.

“I want to join in!” Rylie felt her face flush, but there was no stopping now. “I got _so_ turned on, watching you all day.” She looked back and forth between Erica and Max, still not entirely sure who she meant. “But I can’t just watch anymore.”

“Oh, yes,” Erica exhaled.

“Fuck yeah,” Max growled.

Rylie dropped to her hands and knees and crawled forward. Erica moaned as their lips met. The upside-down kiss was filled with heat. Erica sucked on her bottom lip, and Rylie pushed her tongue between her lips. Then Max thrust forward energetically, shoving Erica back and breaking the kiss.

She made a disappointed sound followed by a surprised gasp as Rylie started kissing down her neck. She crawled forward, over Erica’s body, lips dancing toward her breasts. Eagerly, she wrapped her lips around Erica’s nipple, flicking her tongue against the stiff bud.

Erica moaned and squirmed as Max continued fucking her, and Rylie released one nipple to move to the other. Her breasts were hanging in Erica’s face, who reached up to cup and squeeze them.

Rylie shivered as Erica trapped her nipples between her fingers, rolling and pulling. She released Erica’s with a wet pop and glanced up at Max. He looked like he couldn’t believe his luck. He continued thrusting into Erica, but his eyes were locked on Rylie.

Erica gasped as Rylie continued crawling forward, kissing down Erica’s body. She shivered with delight as Rylie’s lips brushed over her stomach, inching ever lower.

Rylie was tingling with excitement as she moved closer and closer to where Max’s cock was disappearing between Erica’s lips. She found herself panting with lust at the sight of Erica creaming around his shaft. Unable to draw it out any longer, she lunged forward.

Erica squealed as Rylie ran her tongue over her clit and along Max’s cock. The angle was awkward. She had to turn her head to keep from getting jostled out of the way as Max continued fucking Erica. He tried to lean back a bit, to change the angle and make it easier for her.

Rylie eagerly lapped up the cream around the base of his cock, then teased her tongue over and around Erica’s lips, wanting more. Max groaned, and Erica squealed when Rylie’s tongue flicked against her clit. They quickly found a groove, with Rylie excitedly licking them both.

Then it was Rylie’s turn to gasp, as she felt Erica’s fingers exploring her pussy. She groaned, and wrapped her hand around the base of Max’s cock, slick in her grasp as he plunged in and out. When Erica slipped a couple of fingers inside, Rylie pulled Max out on the backstroke, and guided him between her lips instead.

“Oh fuck!” Max exclaimed as he unexpectedly found himself in the heat of her mouth. He didn’t slow down or calm his thrusting. If anything, he seemed to pick up the pace, trying to push deeper. Rylie moaned, feeling Erica’s fingers twisting inside, and tried to relax her throat.

Max shouted in triumph as he grabbed a handful of Rylie’s hair and pushed into her throat. She swallowed, trying not to gag, wanting to take him all the way. Erica lifted her head and wrapped her lips around Rylie’s clit, sucking as her fingers curled. Stars flared at the edges of her vision. All day, she’d been watching them fuck each other, and now they were both fucking her.

Gasping and sputtering, Rylie was finally forced to push Max away, guiding him back into Erica, who cried out at suddenly being filled again. He frantically resumed fucking her, Rylie gasping at the sight of Erica’s pussy swallowing his throbbing cock.

She finally realized what she wanted.

“Max,” she panted. “Will you fuck me?”

“Fuck,” he grunted. “You know I’ve always wanted to!”

“Okay, but you can’t cum inside me.”

“Where do you want me to cum?”

“I want you to fuck me until you’re about to explode, then _use_ Erica’s mouth.”

“Oh!” Erica squealed from between her thighs.

Quickly, they changed positions, so Rylie was lying on her back with her legs spread. Max wasted no time, immediately burying his throbbing cock inside her. His thickness spread her open and filled her completely. She cried out at the overwhelming sensation. As he started fucking her, she felt her walls squeezing and gripping him tightly.

“Holy fuck, Rylie,” Max moaned. “I don’t think I’m gonna last long!”

“Wait!” She begged, rubbing her clit. “Let me cum first!”

Erica was kneeling to one side, watching with awe in her eyes. She had one hand between her thighs and the other was roughly tugging on her nipple. Rylie made eye contact with her, and she moaned.

“Erica, you’re so sexy,” Rylie gasped.

“Rylie!” Erica rocked in place, shamelessly masturbating for her.

The pressure in her core was growing quickly. Max’s cock seemed to stimulate everywhere at once. Waves of sensation rippled from her pussy, tingling along her spine, and sparking at the edge of her vision. Her clit thrummed under her fingers.

“Oh fuck,” she moaned, feeling the pressure build. “Max, keep fucking me! I’m gonna cum!”

Max dug his fingers into her thighs, and thrust with increased fervor. Her core tensed, and she felt a gush of release as her pussy clenched around his cock.

“Erica,” he grunted, trying to hold back. “Come here, I need you!”

“Yeah!” She nearly threw herself forward, lying on her side, and resting her head on Rylie’s pelvis. Max thrust furiously, and Rylie felt his cock twitch, then begin throbbing. Erica opened her lips as Max pulled out of Rylie and buried himself in her mouth.

“Cumming!” He grunted, holding her head in place as he continued thrusting, fucking her mouth. “I’m cumming!”

Rylie’s own orgasm was still rippling as she watched Max use Erica for his pleasure. She moaned happily, swallowing and squirming, with a hand clamped between her thighs.

“Holy fuck,” Rylie gasped.

After a long moment, Max shuddered and pulled out of Erica’s mouth with a wet slurp. He staggered backwards to collapse into the armchair. His erection was finally beginning to soften.

Erica shifted around until she could lay her head on Rylie’s shoulder. She hummed to herself in a satisfied way.

Rylie laughed, and pulled Erica closer, hugging her tightly. She giggled and threw a leg over Rylie’s.

“Erica, I…” Rylie trailed off. There was something important to say, but wasn’t sure how. Had she crossed a line? Was Erica okay? Did she feel the same attraction Rylie could no longer deny?

“Shhh,” she responded. “Everything’s fine, Ry. Relax.”

“What about Max?”

“The fuckboy?” Erica laughed.

“Hey, I heard that,” Max protested groggily.

“You love it,” Erica teased.

“I just,” Rylie worried, “I think I…”

“We can talk about it later.” Erica’s lips met hers in a soft kiss. “Because of you, I’m not going anywhere, remember?”

“Okay.” Rylie blinked, then slowly grinned as the tension bled away, replaced by a warm glow in her chest as Erica snuggled closer. “Yeah.”
