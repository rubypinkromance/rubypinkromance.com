Once a month, my charter boat company makes a run from the mainland to a small private island, home to Goddess Getaway, a women’s-only health and wellness retreat. We take the incoming cohort of about fifteen excited ladies along with that month’s shipment of supplies, and we bring back the departing group.

I sign up for the run every month, and my coworkers think I’m crazy for it.

It’s a long, boring journey. The ride out is rowdy and loud, and the return trip is worse, as the weepy ladies all promise to stay in touch. Usually, at least one passenger gets seasick and doesn’t make it to the side, so you can expect a bit of hose work. Oh, and you have to help unload the crates of supplies.

My coworkers don’t know what they’re missing.

I whistled cheerfully as we approached the island. The passengers were excitedly snapping photos of palm trees and exclaiming over the beachside huts and cabanas. My attention was focused on the dock. I recognized the women waiting for us, even if I only knew them by their “goddess” names.

The tall dark-skinned woman in the flowy silk dress was resort director Parvati. With her confident manner and arms behind her back, she exuded authority. Next to her, with a clipboard, was her second-in-command, Inanna. She wore a linen blouse and a large hat to shield her pale skin from the sun.

As soon as I had the boat secured, the passengers eagerly followed Parvati and Inanna to the central building for orientation, leaving Freya and Artemis behind to help me unload supplies.

“Hey, Luis,” Artemis grinned knowingly. “How was the trip?”

“Loud as always,” I replied with a smile. “How’s island life?”

“Terrible,” she drawled. “We ran out of margarita mix two weeks ago. Good thing you’re here, or I’d have to build a raft to escape.”

“What a nightmare,” I chuckled, handing Freya the first crate.

The two women were a perfect contrast. Dark-haired Artemis, who managed supplies for the island, wore a sardonic expression and an oversized shirt, casually unbuttoned to her navel, with nothing under it. Every time she bent over to take a crate from me, I caught a glimpse of her small breasts and dark, perky nipples. She knew I could see them. She just didn’t care.

Freya, the youngest staff member, was working here over summer break from university. Curvy, with sun-bleached hair brushing her shoulders, she wore jean shorts and a pink bikini top. She was full of nervous energy, and her chest jiggled as she bounced on her heels, waiting for me to hand her another crate.

After we unloaded everything from the boat to the dock, Artemis started stacking flats of produce onto a hand truck.

“I’ll take the food to the kitchen,” she said. “Why don’t you two get everything else over to the supply hut?”

Freya and I made quick work of the remaining supplies, depositing them on the shelves in the building that doubled as storage and a small shop for guest amenities. The looks we exchanged walking back and forth from the dock grew more and more charged. When I dropped my last box and shut the door, she practically threw herself into my arms.

As our lips met, she moaned with need and pushed my shirt up, eager to feel my skin against hers. I slipped one hand into her bikini top and the other down the back of her shorts. She leaned into me, pressing my back against the wall as she urgently unbuttoned my pants.

“I missed you,” she gasped between kisses.

“Hurry,” I groaned, as she wrapped her hand around my rapidly swelling cock. “We don’t have long before Artemis comes back.”

She couldn’t answer because she’d already dropped to her knees, jerked my pants down, and wrapped her lips around me. Her desperate need stoked a fire in my core, and within moments, I was harder than steel.

I helped her to her feet, spinning us around so her back was to the wall. Pushing her bikini aside, I leaned down and pulled as much of her breast as I could into my mouth. She gasped and squirmed as I swirled my tongue, areola contracting into a hard bud. She squeezed my biceps as I undid her shorts and reached inside.

“Ah!” She clamped a hand over her mouth, stifling a cry as my finger curled into her wetness. I switched to her other breast, sucking hard, and pushed deeper. I wondered if she’d been wet all morning, knowing I was coming.

“We don’t have time,” she protested, even as she rocked her pelvis against my hand. “Please—ah!—I need you inside me!”

She shimmied her shorts down around her knees and turned to face the wall. I pressed against her from behind, my cock nestling between her cheeks as I kissed her neck and squeezed her tits. She moaned and reached between us, spreading her legs to rub my head between her slick lips.

“Fuck me,” she begged, bracing herself against the wall.

I thrust forward, burying myself deep inside. She clenched around me and groaned into her hand, trying to keep quiet.

We fell into a rhythm, moving as one. She shuddered with pleasure, pushing back to meet me. I braced a hand on her shoulder, the other on her hip, holding her firmly as I fucked her. It was quick and intense, and it didn’t take long before she was moaning my name.

“Luis!” she gasped, sounding surprised, “you’re gonna make me cum!”

“Do it,” I grunted. “Cum all over my cock!”

“Oh fuck!” Her insides started to flutter rapidly around me. She squealed loudly, unable to stay quiet. “It’s happening!”

“Yes,” I groaned, continuing to thrust into her clenching pussy. Just another minute, and I would shove her against the wall and cum deep inside. “Freya, I’m so close…”

“No,” she moaned, “call me—”

Before she could finish, there was a loud knock on the door. “Hey, did you guys get all that stuff unloaded?” Artemis called. “I need to go over next week’s order with Luis.”

Freya squeaked in alarm and ducked out from under my arms. I groaned in frustration as my cock slipped wetly from between her thighs. She quickly pulled up her shorts and adjusted her bikini top. As I reluctantly tucked my erection back into my pants, she gave me a quick peck on the cheek, glowing with satisfaction.

“Thank you,” she whispered, before opening the door.

Artemis leaned casually against the doorframe. She grinned knowingly as she glanced between Freya’s flushed chest, her “nothing to hide” expression, and my obvious discomfort.

“Everything’s put away,” Freya blurted. “I’m going for a showe… er, a walk,” she quickly corrected. “See you at dinner, Artemis. Bye, Luis!”

I waved to her retreating back as Artemis stepped inside and let the door shut behind her. She hopped up on a large box, still smirking at me.

“So,” I asked, raising one eyebrow, “how long were you listening at the door?”

“Long enough,” she grinned. “I had to stop her before she told you her name. As you know,” she said, adopting a mockingly serious tone, “we have a strict policy regarding staff using their real names. Goddess names help our guests feel more empowered during their visit.”

“That’s a dead-on impression of Parvati,” I chuckled.

“Thanks, I’ve been practicing. But, from the way you’re staring at my chest,” she purred, pulling her shirt a bit further open, “I doubt my impressions are what you’re interested in.”

“I thought you wanted to talk about next week’s order?” I teased.

“The only thing I require on that boat is you. This island is lovely, but it’s also a taco fest. A girl has needs, you know?”

“I do know,” I grinned, stepping closer.

“Show me,” she purred, pulling my head to her chest.

I wrapped my lips around one of her nipples, already stiff against my tongue, as I undid the last few buttons on her shirt. She sighed happily and let it slip down her shoulders as I alternated between breasts. They were smaller than Freya’s, but judging by how quickly she started squirming, much more sensitive.

I kissed down her stomach until I reached the waistband of her shorts. She ran her fingers through my hair as I unfastened them and helped me slip them off, along with her underwear.

I dropped to my knees and parted her legs. She bit her finger, grinning as she watched me savor the sight of her pussy. I spread her lips reverently, already puffy with excitement. She gasped as I licked deep, letting the taste of her arousal coat my tongue, then moved up to tease around her clit.

“Luis,” she moaned, squeezing her thighs around my head, “hurry up and pull your cock out. Freya’s not the only one who was waiting for you.”

Eagerly, I stood up and unbuttoned my pants, letting them fall around my ankles. My cock had gone a bit soft, I realized, as I wrapped my hand around the base and tried to pump it back to life. Seeing my problem, Artemis jumped down off the box and wrapped her lips around my head.

“Mmm!” She pulled back, licking her lips and grinning up at me. “Tastes like Freya.”

“How do you know what Freya tastes like?”

“Please,” she crinkled her eyes. “The girl’s in college and works at a women’s retreat. A bit of experimentation is par for the course.” Having planted that image in my mind, she gleefully swallowed me whole.

“Fuck!” I startled, feeling her tongue dance along the underside of my quickly swelling shaft. I expected her to back up, but she held me in place, bobbing her head and letting me grow until I was pressing against the back of her throat. “Oh my god, how are you so good at that?”

“I didn’t always live on a girl’s-only island,” she laughed, releasing me with a wet slurp. “Now, are you going to fuck me, or should I go find Freya in the shower?”

In answer, I reached under her arms and lifted her back onto the box. She laughed and spread her legs for me, leaning back on her elbows as I stepped into position. I slipped between her lips, then looked her in the eyes as I slammed into her with one hard thrust.

“Shit!” She wrapped her legs around me, hooking her heels behind my ass. “That’s what I’m talking about, Luis. Fuck me hard! I want to feel your cock deep—Ah!”

This wasn’t the first time Artemis and I had done it, and I’d learned that she didn’t believe in wasting time. She wanted me to fuck her fast and hard, until she was writhing and moaning and clawing my back.

I gave her what she wanted.

The smell of sex filled the air, musky and fragrant. The wet sound of our bodies slapping together echoed in the small space, astonishingly loud. After being interrupted with Freya, I wanted nothing more than to bury myself in the heat of her pussy and cum.

Artemis stared up at me through lust-filled eyes, grunting each time I thrust into her. She slapped a hand against her chest, squeezing her breast and trapping the nipple between two fingers. I groaned, loud, when she reached down with her other hand to rub her clit, making her insides squeeze around me.

“Fuck me,” she begged. “Keep fucking me. I love the way you fuck me…”

She trailed off, talking to herself more than me. I felt my cock swelling, and knew my climax was approaching. She felt it, too, and moaned, arching her back. Her pussy clenched suddenly, gripping me tight, and she cried out as hot liquid gushed around my cock.

She swore and slapped the box repeatedly, squeezing her legs around me, holding me in place as she came. I was so close… I dug my fingers into her hips, desperate to cum, when another knock sounded at the door.

“We’re not open yet,” she moaned, hoping it was a guest looking for supplies.

“It’s Inanna,” came the reply. “You were supposed to bring Luis by the office?”

Artemis cursed and pushed me away. “Just a sec,” she called. I didn’t want to stop when I was so close, but she managed to slip out of my grasp, popping my cock out in the process. I groaned with frustration and leaned against the box with my erection jutting into the air, throbbing and dripping with her juices.

“Get dressed,” she hissed at me, pulling up her shorts and shrugging her shirt back onto her shoulders. “I completely forgot, Inanna said she had some paperwork for you.”

Once again, I tucked my painfully hard cock away. Artemis gave me a quick inspection, hesitating at the sight of the erection attempting to burst through my pants, and opened the door.

Outside, Inanna stood waiting in her sun hat, clutching her clipboard. She frowned at my sweaty, disheveled appearance and shot a look at Artemis, who shrugged and gestured at all the crates we’d just put away.

“Come with me, Luis, we don’t have long before the departing cohort makes their way to the dock.”

She turned on her heel and walked off toward the office. I looked back at Artemis, who winked, blew me a kiss, and pulled her shirt open to give me a parting glimpse of her breast. Sighing, I followed Inanna to the office.

She let me in and shut the door behind us. It was blessedly cool inside, one of the few buildings on the island with air conditioning. Inanna sighed happily and hung her hat on a hook before throwing her arms around me and falling into a passionate kiss.

My cock throbbed excitedly, jabbing into her hip, until she pulled away and slapped me, hard. The sharp sound reverberated.

I sighed. This again.

“I told you, you have to stop coming here. This is my work! I’m a married woman, Luis. Anyone could see you with me and tell my husband.”

“Inanna,” I said, holding up my hands to ward her off. “I don’t think we have time for role-play.”

“You brute,” she continued, ignoring my protest. Her lips curled into a sneer, but her eyes twinkled with excitement. “You just won’t take no for an answer, will you? All you care about is satisfying your urges… Your raw, animal urges.”

I looked at my watch and frowned, hoping she’d skip most of the backstory for this little scenario she’d imagined, and just tell me what she wanted to do.

“You obviously won’t be happy,” she grinned wickedly, “until you’ve ripped my panties off and fucked me over this desk.”

There it was! Following her lead, I grabbed her by the shoulder and shoved her facedown onto the desktop. She squealed with mock outrage as I lifted her skirt and roughly pulled down her underwear. I pinned one arm behind her back as I unbuttoned my pants, freeing my erection.

“You beast!” she protested with a laugh, wriggling in my grasp. “You’re too big! It’ll never fit—Oh!”

Still slick with Artemis’ juices, I rudely shoved my cock straight into her. She moaned, role-play forgotten, as I started fucking her. I’d been so close before she interrupted. If she wanted me to play the part of the single-minded man using her body for his pleasure, I was happy to do so.

Her pussy gripped me tight, squeezing as I pushed in, and grasping as I pulled out, reluctant to let me go. My cock was harder than it had ever been. She moaned as I thrust deep, slamming into her from behind. Her desk drawers rattled, and a mug full of pens fell to the ground with a clatter, scattering everywhere.

“Luis,” she grunted, gripping the edge of the desk with white knuckles. “Fuck! You’re fucking me so hard!”

“That’s what you wanted,” I groaned.

“Yes!” she panted. “Don’t stop! Don’t you fucking stop!”

I didn’t. I couldn’t. With single-minded determination, I thrust into her over and over, savoring the sensation of wet heat clenching around me. Abruptly, I pulled out, making her whimper in protest. “Turn around,” I growled. “I want to look at you when I cum.”

Eagerly, she rolled onto her back, spreading her legs for me. I stepped forward, putting her feet over my shoulders and slipping the head of my cock back into her sopping pussy. When I pushed further inside, she moaned and arched her back.

“Let me see your tits while I fuck you.”

Breathlessly, she pulled up her blouse, along with the band of her bralette. Her breasts bounced with every thrust, until she moaned and squeezed them together, pinching and pulling her nipples. Her eyes met mine, wide with hunger.

“Your pussy feels so good,” I moaned. “I’m gonna cum so hard.”

“Oh!” she gasped, and I felt her clench excitedly. “Yes!”

“Does that turn you on? Knowing that I’m using you? That I’m going to bury my cock deep and fill you with my cum?”

In answer, she let out a long, low cry of pleasure and her eyes rolled back in her head. Her legs went stiff against my shoulders. I felt her pussy rippling around my shaft. Then, with a sudden spasm, she went limp in my grasp.

I kept thrusting, but she’d gotten so wet I could barely feel anything. I snarled in frustration, desperate for release.

“Oh my, she gets quite juicy when she climaxes, doesn’t she?”

Parvati’s voice from behind startled me. I spun around, my cock pulling free so quickly it flung a long strand of creamy liquid, which splattered on the floor at her feet.

My erection jutted towards Parvati, who regarded it with amusement. My heart hammered, both from exertion and worry. Having just pulled out of Inanna, and literally dripping with her wetness, there was no denying what was happening.

“Just how many of my staff do you intend to fuck today, Luis?”

“Uh…” I stammered. “How did you…?”

“Security camera in the supply hut,” she responded calmly. “After I dropped the new girls off at orientation, I stopped by my office, and was rather surprised to see you with Freya. And then Artemis.”

“Oh.” I grimaced and wondered if I should pull up my pants. I felt foolish with them bunched around my ankles.

“Don’t worry,” she said, waving aside my concern. “It all looked enthusiastically consensual. With the exception of Inanna, here, but clearly the two of you were acting out some fantasy.”

I nodded dumbly. My erection was throbbing with desperate need, but it didn’t seem like a good idea to ask if she could give me a minute to finish up with her assistant.

“I admit to some concern, Luis,” she said, gesturing at my cock. “You are still in a state of dire arousal, but you’ve done such a thorough job fucking Inanna that she’s passed out.”

I followed her gaze to the desk, where she was still quivering with aftershocks.

“I’m sure she would eagerly return the favor, but…” Parvati frowned at her watch. “The departing group will be making their way to the dock momentarily, and I’d rather not risk any poor reviews because you left them waiting.”

Sighing with disappointment, I reached down to pull up my pants.

“However,” she said, arresting my motion. “Your current state may impact your ability to safely pilot your craft.”

I hesitated.

“I don’t think it would be safe,” she said, tapping a fingernail against her lower lip, “to send you out there this… distracted. And the girls won’t get restless immediately. I’d guess we have maybe fifteen minutes to resolve your situation.”

“We?” I shot a confused glance at Inanna.

“You and I, Luis.” As she spoke, she began calmly undressing. “I’ll admit to some curiosity after seeing you in action.” Her body was stunning. Round hips, dark brown skin, large nipples, and a neatly trimmed patch of pubic hair. My cock twitched at the sight, and she smiled appreciatively. “Come, sit on the couch.”

I did as I was told, and she wasted no time moving to straddle me. Leaning forward, she allowed me to bury my face between her breasts as she got us in position. Feeling her lips part around my head, I groaned and tried to push her down, but she swatted my hands away.

“Slowly,” she purred. “I said I was curious, but that doesn’t mean I’m as ready as the others. You’re well lubricated, but give me a moment to ease you in.”

She braced on my shoulders and began to lower herself, painstakingly slowly. I groaned and gripped the couch cushions. It took every bit of self-control I had not to thrust up into her. My system was on fire.

I tried to distract myself by sucking on her tits. She cradled my head to her chest and continued easing down my shaft. I flicked my tongue around her nipple. She purred appreciatively, but didn’t speed up. I groaned and pulled more of her breast into my mouth, struggling to restrain myself.

When she finally settled her weight against my thighs, I groaned loudly. She threw her head back and sighed with satisfaction, savoring the feeling of my cock buried fully inside her.

“Oh, that feels good,” she murmured. “It’s been awhile.”

“Parvati,” I begged. “Please!”

“Patience, Luis. We’re not in so desperate a rush that I can’t enjoy the moment.”

I moaned into her cleavage, until she laughed and began moving.

Most girls get on top, and they start bouncing, riding like a cowgirl. Parvati danced. She moved sinuously, like a belly dancer. Her body rolled in waves, rocking back and forth on my pelvis.

I laid my head back and gazed up at her in wonder. She took my hands and drew them over her body, incorporating my touch into her choreography. I caressed her breasts, neck, sides, and hips.

She stared at me confidently, lips quirked in a smile as she expertly kept me on the edge, never quite allowing me to finish. My cock throbbed, and she responded in kind, rippling around me as if it were part of the dance. Her breathing quickened along with her pace, rocking quickly, squeezing me from the inside.

“Now, Luis,” she purred, “you may take your pleasure.”

I let out a low growl, grabbed her ass, and pulled her tighter against me. My desperate need boiled to the surface. Her warmth wrapped tightly around my shaft, and I grunted, knowing release was imminent.

“Cum,” she instructed.

I did, exploding deep inside her. She sighed happily as my cock pulsed and twitched, pouring my long-denied climax into her welcoming body. My vision contracted until all I could see was her face, whispering soft words of encouragement.

All too soon, she climbed off, making me shudder as I slipped out. Thick cream slowly dripped down her thigh as she calmly retrieved a box of tissues, passing me one to clean up.

“Be quick, Luis,” she reminded me. “You have a boat waiting.”

I nodded, and pulled my clothes back on while glancing at Inanna, still humming distractedly on the desk.

“Don’t worry, I’ll tell her what happened. We’ll work up some sort of roster with the other girls to ensure you don’t get double-booked like this on your future visits. Now, go!”

I ran out the door, grinning, still buttoning my pants, and already dreaming about my next trip to the island.
