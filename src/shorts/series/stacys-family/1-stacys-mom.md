Jo moaned as she held the rumbling head of the vibrator to her clit. It was a hot afternoon, and she was lying on her back in the bedroom with her legs spread wide. Sunshine streamed in the open windows, along with a gentle breeze that danced over her bare skin. She could smell fresh-cut grass, the lingering scent of her body wash, and her arousal.

Her husband Tom was away on business again. Her girls Stacy and Flora were at their dad’s, and Tom’s son Hudson was on a camping trip with friends. So, she found herself home alone for a week, bored, and so horny she wanted to scream.

The magic wand buzzed continuously, sending intense waves of pleasure radiating through her core. She arched her back and cried out in pleasure, hoping Chad could hear.

The young handyman had arrived this morning, toolbox in hand, wearing basketball shorts and a threadbare t-shirt with a faded band logo. She met him at the door in yoga pants and a sports bra. As she walked him through the house, pointing out things that needed doing, his eyes explored her body with a lack of subtlety she would have found shocking if it wasn’t exactly what she’d been hoping for.

When he wasn’t looking, she tweaked her nipples, ensuring they stood proud for him. She’d noted the outline of his package when he reached up to grab something for her, and tried to return the favor, bending over longer than necessary while showing him a squeaky spot on the stairs.

In the backyard, she’d watched approvingly as he peeled off his shirt to work on the broken patio umbrella. He didn’t seem to mind the attention. At one point, he caught her looking, flipped the sun-bleached hair out of his eyes, and gave her a wink that left her thinking scandalous thoughts.

Chad came recommended by another mom on the block, and now she could see why. No doubt he earned quite a bit in tips from lonely housewives all over town. She hoped he was interested in more than just the tip today.

As she rocked her hips repeatedly, thrusting against the vibrator, she resisted the urge to check if he was watching. When she last saw him, he’d been fixing the leaky faucet in the kitchen. She’d told him she was going to take a quick shower, then “carelessly” left the bedroom door cracked open. Was he out there right now?

She moaned again, louder this time. It made her feel a bit ridiculous, but she reminded herself that guys his age watched a lot of porn. They were used to a more exaggerated and vocal performance than her generation.

She strained her ears for any indication he was watching. Silence. It was probably a good sign that she couldn’t hear him working anymore, but if he was out there, he was staying very quiet.

“Fuck,” she groaned, “I’m so wet!” That, at least, wasn’t an exaggeration.

This was frustrating. She’d imagined with a guy his age, it would be like ringing a dinner bell, that he would hear her siren call and come running. She hadn’t even considered he might have enough self-control to watch. Time to kick it up a notch.

“Oh, Chad!” She squirmed, clawing at the sheet. “It feels so good when you lick my clit!”

A sudden noise from the hallway. Bingo!

She risked a quick glance. Chad was just visible peeking through the gap in the doorway, eyes wide. Something about his posture made it clear he was touching himself. A triumphant wave of lust crashed over her, and she moaned again.

Then she sat up abruptly, pretending to notice him. He startled and ducked out of sight.

“Oh my god, Chad?” She scrambled to cover her breasts with her arms, not doing a very good job. In the process, she knocked the magic wand off the bed. It landed on the floor with a noisy clatter and continued to vibrate angrily as she reached to switch it off. “What are you doing out there?”

“Shit!” She heard him curse as he pulled up his shorts, realizing he’d been caught. He opened the door, covering his eyes as if he hadn’t already seen everything. “Sorry! I’m sorry!” He winced. “I didn’t mean to spy on you. I just heard a noise, and was worried you were, like, hurt or something.”

She tried not to smile at the outline of his twitching cock, barely contained by the thin fabric of his shorts, straining to be released. She put on her best “shocked, but also a little flattered” expression.

“Is that, um…” She pointed at his erection. “Is that because of me?”

“Well, yeah,” he said with a sheepish grin, lowering his hand from his eyes. “After I saw you weren’t, like, in trouble or whatever, I kinda, um, watched you?”

“Oh. Oh! Oh no! How long were you watching? Did you hear…”

“Yeah,” he admitted. “I heard you say my name. Like, I was already turned on, but that’s when I started jerking off. I know I shouldn’t have, but you’re _so_ hot.”

“You think I’m hot?” She allowed herself to smile.

“Oh, yeah!” His confidence grew as he realized he wasn’t in trouble. “You’re a smoke show.”

“So, you know what I was fantasizing about?”

“About me goin’ down on you.” He grinned.

“And how do you feel about that?” She sat up straighter, uncovering her breasts, and raising a curious eyebrow.

“I mean, I do love eatin’ pussy.” He hooked a thumb in his waistband, considering. “But, aren’t you married and stuff?”

“Yes.” She bit her lip. “But Tom’s not here to attend to my needs right now. You are. And judging by that throbbing in your shorts, you’ve got some needs as well. Maybe we could help each other?”

“You won’t tell him?” He looked excited, but still worried.

“I think this can stay our little secret.”

“Cool.” He grinned. “Cool.”

He pulled his shirt over his head with one easy motion. She opened her legs, beckoning him to come closer. He lay on his stomach and lowered his face between her thighs.

She gasped when she felt his hot breath on her skin, and moaned as he plunged his tongue between her lips. He licked the length of her, eagerly spreading her open with his fingers. Wasting no time, he found a rhythm, pushing inside, then dragging up to circle her clit, and back down again.

“Oh fuck!” She let out a shuddering breath she hadn’t realized she’d been holding. It had been too long since someone had properly eaten her out. Richard, her first husband, had been good at it, but Tom was uninterested. Until this moment, she hadn’t realized how much she missed it.

He was certainly enthusiastic, working his face back and forth with his tongue buried astonishingly deep, nose rubbing her clit. The magic wand had gotten her nicely warmed up, leaving her pleasantly sensitive as he lapped up the wetness that flowed from her like a spring.

“Chad, lick my clit,” she groaned, echoing what she’d cried out before. He said something unintelligible as she grabbed his hair, pulling him upward until his lips found the spot. He flicked his tongue, making her jump, then settled into a steady routine of kissing, sucking, and licking tight little circles.

“Oh my god, who taught you that?” She purred, arching her back and tightening her grip on his hair to hold him firmly in place. A warm glow was spreading through her body.

“I need your fingers,” she moaned. His weight shifted, and she shuddered as thick fingers filled her. He curled them repeatedly, rocking in and out of her. Her clit thrummed on his tongue.

“Oh! Like that! Yes! Keep going!” She felt the pressure mounting, and knew the first orgasm would crackle through her like lightning, leaving her ready for more. “You’re making me cum!”

He closed his lips around her clit and sucked. She screamed and squeezed her thighs around his head. He moved with her bucking hips, riding the waves that rolled through her body, until she finally released him. When he pulled out, she covered her sensitive clit with her palm, rocking in place with the aftershocks.

He stood up, wiping his chin on his arm and looking quite pleased with himself. Eagerly, he pulled down his shorts, revealing an impressive cock, already standing at attention. She expected him to climb on top of her, but he walked around the side of the bed to kneel by her head.

“Before I fuck you,” he grinned, “wanna suck on this cock?”

“Oh!” She was shocked by how easily he asked for what he wanted. Another generational difference, she thought. He waited patiently, stroking himself just over her face, not quite touching her. She licked her lips as a glistening bead of precum appeared, surprised to realize she wanted to taste it. “Yes,” she breathed.

He smiled and touched himself to her lips. Tentatively, she licked the tip, then traced around the ridge of his head. He braced himself on the headboard to more easily lean over her as she opened her mouth for him.

He rocked his hips forward, groaning as his swollen head passed her lips. She rolled onto her side to improve the angle, and reached up to wrap a hand around the base of his shaft. He throbbed as she enthusiastically sucked, exploring his masculine flavor.

“Oh fuck, your mouth is so hot,” he exclaimed, looking down as he pushed deeper. She tried to relax, sensing his eagerness. He bumped against the back of her mouth, pulled back a moment, then pushed in again. She swallowed and squeezed his root, feeling his heartbeat in her hand.

A moment of resistance, as she shifted her head, and he suddenly slipped into her throat. She struggled not to choke as he started thrusting. He twitched against her tongue, and cried out, grabbing the back of her head and pulling her forward so he could fuck her throat.

She swallowed repeatedly to avoid gagging as he finally buried himself to the hilt. He moaned, and his cock throbbed as he held her in place. She groaned and squirmed, eyes watering, squeezing her legs together as her insides clenched.

Finally, she had to smack his leg until he released her. She choked as he pulled out. For a moment, a long, thick strand of saliva connected his tip to her lips, until she wiped it away.

“Jesus,” she sputtered. “You really wanted my throat, huh?”

“That felt incredible,” he groaned, still stroking his cock directly over her face.

“Fuck me,” she coughed, rolling onto her back and squeezing her breasts.

“Sorry, I couldn’t help myself,” he shrugged.

“No, I mean come here and fuck me!”

He laughed, and climbed between her legs, rubbing the head of his cock between her lips. She pulled him on top of her, wrapping her legs around to lock her heels behind his ass. They both gasped in surprise as he slipped effortlessly inside. Her pussy clenched excitedly, suddenly full. His weight felt delicious against her clit, and she rolled her hips as he rocked into her.

They moved easily together. He thrust with increasing urgency, gasping in her ear. She welcomed him, using her legs to pull him back every time he withdrew. He filled her perfectly, stretching her open, stimulating her with his entire length. She hooked her hands over his shoulders, and buried her face in his neck, letting his smell fill her nostrils.

Her body pulsed with nearly overwhelming sensation. Behind her closed eyes, she saw flares of color with each thrust, like a private fireworks show. He was grunting now, straining with effort as he moved eagerly inside her.

Abruptly, he pulled back, lifting himself up on his elbows to look at her as they fucked. His expression was awe-struck. She stared back, astonished by his attention. She shivered and clenched around him. He moaned loudly and started fucking her harder and faster.

Her legs came unhooked, and her tits bounced with every thrust. She squealed and grabbed them, trapping her nipples between her fingers. The pressure was rapidly building. Her toes curled, gripping the sheet, as her core clenched tightly, desperately trying to hold him inside.

“Oh fuck!” He groaned, hair plastered to his forehead with sweat. “You just got so tight!”

“Ah!” She cried, “You’re making me cum again!”

Her vision blurred into a haze as he continued to fuck her through the orgasm. Every time his pelvis crushed her, it made her clit tingle. Her nipples seemed to sing as she pulled them, and a warm heat spread as she gushed around his cock. For a few minutes, it was all she could do not to pass out from the overwhelming crush of sensation.

“You feel so good,” he blurted. “I’m getting close!”

Head swimming, still awash with pleasure, she considered letting him cum inside. She wanted to feel him bury himself deeply, holding there, flooding her until he collapsed, spent, on top of her. She would savor his weight, and the spreading warmth inside.

But that’s what Tom always did. He never asked, he just claimed her for his own. She loved it, but she wanted something different with Chad. She remembered the way he’d confidently asked her to go down on him. Could she do the same? Could she just _ask_ for what she wanted?

What _did_ she want? She wasn’t sure, only that she wanted him to do something her husband didn’t. Something to set this encounter apart. Thrillingly different from the ordinary.

Should she tell him to get behind her? She imagined him squeezing her hips so hard he left marks. Maybe pull her hair? Or slap her ass, hard, just before he pulled out and came all over her back? No, that was tempting, but she wouldn’t be able to see him.

“Oh fuck,” he groaned. “I’m gonna cum so hard!”

That was it! She wanted to watch him cum. Wanted him to fuck her until he couldn’t take it anymore, then pull out and cum for her. Cum _on_ her. She wanted to see the expression on his face as he painted her. See the way his cock twitched, feel his hot cum on…

“My tits,” she gasped eagerly. “Will you cum on my tits?”

He quickly pulled out and got to his knees, wrapping his hand around his cock. He thrust wetly into his fist, the head emerging from his grip, pointed directly at her chest, already leaking creamy precum over his fingers.

She watched eagerly as he fucked his hand, leaning forward so far she worried he’d fall over. His cock throbbed and twitched in his grasp. He stared hungrily at her tits, nipples tightly pebbled, awaiting his cum.

“Fuck!” He cried out as the first spurt erupted, shooting over her chest to splatter hotly against her collarbone. She shuddered, clit singing below her fingers, as thick ropes of cum fell on her skin. There was an astonishing amount, covering her chest until it collected in the valley between her breasts.

The last shot landed on her belly, then he collapsed on the bed next to her, panting with exertion. She found herself humming quietly, idly tracing her fingers through his cum. He watched breathlessly as she rubbed it into her breasts, as if she were moisturizing. The comparison made her laugh, and he joined in, giddy with endorphins.

A pleasant breeze rolled through the window, cooling her wet skin. Probably, she should get in the shower before his spunk started drying. But her body was still buzzing with arousal, and she knew she wasn’t done yet.

Chad loped into the bathroom to clean up. She reached for the magic wand again. By the time he came back, the powerful vibrations had her well on the way to another orgasm.

She considered how he must see her. The sexy older woman he’d caught masturbating. Who’d invited him in for a fuck, and let him shoot his load all over her chest. Who was still masturbating, writhing on the bed, covered in his cum. For a moment, she saw herself through his eyes, and felt a rush of confidence and arousal.

What did he think would happen next? Was he expecting her to say the money was on the counter, and to see himself out? Perhaps he thought she was a lonely housewife, desperate for company, who would invite him to stay for dinner. Or maybe he just wanted to go for round two. She considered what she wanted from him.

“Chad,” she moaned.

“Yeah?” He sounded hopeful.

“How quickly do you think you can finish the rest of the list I gave you?”

“Oh.” Clearly disappointed, and prepared to be dismissed, he shrugged. “Um, probably, like, twenty minutes?”

“Good,” she purred. “If you can get back here before I switch this off, I’ll let you fuck me again.”

“Sweet!” He ran out the door, still pulling his shorts up.

She moaned long and low as the pressure started building again, hoping the sound would motivate him. She was already thinking about what to put on the maintenance list the next time her husband left town.
