excerpt: Marcy sneaks into Bonnie’s room, but they nearly get caught.

“Why are you sitting way over there?”

Marcy grinned at the text. It was from her girlfriend, Bonnie, who was currently sitting across from her at the airport. They were waiting at the crowded departure gate with the rest of their team to board a plane to MIT for the robotics competition.

“Sorry,” she texted back. “I got distracted because SOMEONE hasn’t stopped texting me since we got off the bus, and when I looked up, all the other seats were taken.”

“So?” Bonnie grinned. “Get over here and tell Amy to fuck off and sit somewhere else. Or just come sit on my lap.”

“I don’t think Coach Sam would like that.”

“Who cares what she likes, I want you on top of me.”

Marcy looked around to make sure no one was looking at her phone. Bonnie’s texts had been escalating from playful to explicit, and she was a little worried someone would see.

“Well,” she responded, “maybe they’ll let us share a room.”

“Fuck me, that would be amazing.” Bonnie winked at her. “I’d keep you up all night. You could send me home covered in hickeys.”

“You’re making it hard to think about anything else.”

“I can’t help it, you’re so fucking hot.”

Unconsciously, Marcy ran a hand through her dark hair. She’d recently gotten an overtly queer asymmetric cut and had been worried about what Bonnie, always the more traditionally femme of the two, would think. Turns out, she had nothing to worry about.

“Hey,” Bonnie sent, “guess what I’m wearing?”

Knowing Marcy would immediately look up, Bonnie casually stretched, her crop top lifting just enough to tease a glimpse of pink lace. She was wearing the sexy longline bra they’d bought together on a memorable shopping trip that had ended with a lap dance in the dressing room.

“I love the way that looks on you,” Marcy texted, “It turns me on so much.”

“Good, because your leather jacket gets me wet.”

“Be patient, Bon-bon.”

“I don’t want to be patient. I want you to pull my hair.”

Marcy shifted in her seat as Bonnie shot her a wicked look, licking her lips as she adjusted her ponytail, tugging her blonde hair back just a bit harder than necessary.

“Stop!” Marcy mouthed the word, glancing nervously at Coach Sam, a few seats away, worried they’d get caught. Bonnie just grinned and picked up her phone.

“I need your fingers.”

“Fuck, Bonnie.”

“Yeah, fuck Bonnie! Now you’re getting it.”

“You’re gonna get it,” she texted, weakly.

“Get what? Your head between my thighs?”

Marcy squeezed her legs together, uncomfortably aware of how aroused she was becoming.

“Bonnie, please,” she texted. “I can’t make it through the flight if you get me all worked up.”

Marcy shot her a pleading look. Bonnie gave her an understanding smile. Then she stood up and started walking away, tucking her phone into the back pocket of her jean shorts.

“Bonnie,” Coach Sam called, “Where are you going?”

“Just to the bathroom,” she replied without stopping.

“Okay, well, listen for our flight announcement, we should be boarding soon!”

Marcy took a deep breath and tried to clear her head. Now that Bonnie was done texting, it was time to slow things down and make it through the flight.

Her phone buzzed again.

It was a photo of Bonnie from the bathroom stall. She was lifting her shirt and sticking out her tongue. Her dark nipples were clearly visible through the thin lace of her bra.

“Come see how wet I am.”

Fuck. Two more texts came one after another.

“Push me against the wall.”

“Suck on my nipples.”

She checked the time. Their flight would start boarding in ten minutes. They’d have to be quick. She responded with a running emoji and stood up.

“Last stall, hurry.” Bonnie texted back.

“Marcy,” Coach Sam warned as she walked away.

“I know, I know, I’ll be quick!” She broke into a jog.

Miraculously, the bathroom was nearly deserted. Almost all the stalls were unoccupied, and there was only one woman in a nice suit washing her hands.

Marcy walked straight to the last stall. The door was closed but not locked, and she opened it to find Bonnie grinning at her.

They fell into each other’s arms, Marcy fumbling to lock the door, then pushing her girlfriend against the wall, urgently kissing her. They were both flooded with lust.

“Oh, fuck, I’m glad you came,” Bonnie gasped, stifling a squeal as Marcy reached under her crop top to squeeze her nipples.

“How could I not?” Marcy whispered, “You’re so goddamn sexy, and you’ve been teasing me.”

“I wasn’t teasing, I’m yours,” she purred, reaching under Marcy’s leather jacket to caress her sides and chest. “And I need your fingers.”

Remembering how little time they had, Marcy unbuttoned Bonnie’s shorts and reached into her panties. She was already squirming as Marcy worked a finger between her lips. As promised, she was already wet.

“Please,” Bonnie whispered. But Marcy paused, making eye contact as she reached her other hand up to grip Bonnie’s ponytail. She nodded, and Marcy pulled, gently at first, but increasingly firmly, tipping her head back, before finally slipping her finger inside.

Bonnie immediately started gasping as Marcy fingered her and sucked on her neck. She arched her back, desperate for more. Marcy felt her lust surging as she released Bonnie’s hair and added a second finger.

Panting with each thrust of her fingers, Bonnie tugged up Marcy’s shirt and began kissing down her chest, scooping a breast from her strappy black bra.

“We don’t have long,” Marcy exhaled, fingers buried in her girlfriend’s soaking pussy.

“Rub my clit,” Bonnie panted, closing her lips around the brunette’s nipple.

Marcy shifted her hand, pressing her palm against the sensitive bud. Bonnie rolled her hips, grinding against the pressure, moaning into Marcy’s breast, and moving urgently towards her release. Marcy moved her hand faster until Bonnie suddenly went stiff, releasing her nipple with a wet sound and gasped into her cleavage.

Feeling her need surging, Marcy pulled her hand out and pushed Bonnie back against the wall, frantically kissing her. Urgently, she pulled up Bonnie’s top, wet fingers squeezing her breasts through the thin fabric, leaving her moaning and grabbing Marcy’s ass to pull her closer, grinding against her thigh—when they suddenly heard the final boarding announcement for their flight.

Laughing, they pulled their clothes back into place and ran out of the stall holding hands.

It was a very long flight, not made any easier by her damp underwear and the lingering scent of Bonnie on her fingers. Their seats were far apart, and she spent most of the time watching videos on her phone, trying to distract herself.

When they finally arrived at the dorms that MIT provided, Marcy was disappointed but not surprised that the coaches put her and Bonnie in separate rooms. She was sharing a room with Rylie, and Bonnie was next door with Amy.

Her first stop was the restroom, to change into a dry pair of underwear, sports bra, soft t-shirt, and lounge pants.

By eleven, Rylie was already in bed wearing a sleep mask, but Marcy was still too wound up to sleep. It was hours earlier than she normally went to bed. She found herself sitting on top of the covers, screwing around on her phone.

It buzzed with a text from Bonnie: “Still awake?”

“Yeah, I can’t sleep this early.” She grinned and added, “Plus, you got me all worked up earlier.”

“Sorry, not sorry. You look so fucking hot in that leather jacket.”

“When do you think we can be alone again? Sucks they wouldn’t let us share a room. No love for the gays, I guess.”

“Soon, I hope. I can’t stop thinking about the way you took me at the airport.”

“I couldn’t stop thinking about you during the flight.”

“Mmm tell me more.” Marcy could imagine Bonnie purring as she said it.

She shot a look toward her roommate, trying to judge if she was asleep yet. Rylie was rolled away, facing the wall, and breathing slowly… but then she scratched her arm and adjusted her pillow.

“I was thinking about your lips around my nipple.”

“You’re so fucking sexy.”

“Thinking about how you moved against me when I put my fingers in you.”

“I love your fingers.”

“Thinking about what I would do next.”

“Tell me.”

“I want to take off your top and push you down on the bed and suck on your tits.”

“Yesss. What then?”

“Kiss my way down your front and pull your panties down just enough to lick you.”

“That’s hot. I love seeing you look up at me from between my legs. I want to run my fingers through your hair.”

“I’d pull your underwear off and finger you while I lick your clit. I won’t stop until you have to scream into a pillow.”

“Mmm, I want that so bad. When you’re done, I wa”

Marcy blinked at the screen. The text ended abruptly, and just when it was getting good. Probably, Bonnie was typing one-handed. She grinned, and looked at Rylie, trying to judge whether she could get away with doing the same when her phone buzzed again.

“OMG get over here quick. Amy just left.”

Marcy sat bolt upright. Holy shit. Amy had been flirting aggressively with Ian all day long. If she’d snuck out, it was probably to go hook up with him somewhere. Which meant Bonnie was alone in the next room!

Carefully, she padded barefoot toward the door. Rylie didn’t react. She was about to open it when she heard footsteps coming down the hall. Concerned it was Amy returning, she hesitated until she heard the bathroom door open and shut. After a moment, she slipped out, closing the door behind her as quietly as she could. There was no sign of anyone, though she could hear a TV playing in the common room. Cautiously, she opened the door to the next room.

Bonnie was sitting up in bed, grinning from ear to ear. She was wearing grey sleep shorts and a pink tank top with no bra. Her nipples poked excitedly through the cotton.

“Holy shit,” Marcy grinned.

“Right?” Bonnie agreed.

“Babe, I heard someone come down the hall and go into the bathroom. Do you think it was Amy?”

“Maybe?” Bonnie shrugged. “She said she was going to the bathroom, but she had this look in her eyes like she thought she was being _so_ clever. I mean, she obviously went to fuck Ian, right?”

“Oh, for sure, she was all over him today.”

“Okay, so,” Bonnie bit her lip. “Can we…?”

“Fuck yes.”

Marcy climbed onto the bed, but Bonnie put a hand on her shoulder.

“What if we’re wrong? What if Amy comes back?”

“She can watch,” Marcy replied with a grin.

“Oh really?” Bonnie laughed. “Well, if we’re fantasizing, why not ask her to join us?”

“Hell no, I’m not sharing you.”

“Good answer. What if she tells Coach Sam?”

“Coach Sam can watch, too.”

“Hm,” Bonnie considered, a twinkle in her eyes. “Okay, but for real, that’s super hot.”

“Yeah?” Marcy moved closer, nuzzling her neck. “You like the idea of an audience?”

“Maybe… I’ve never really thought about it before.”

“Seems like you’re thinking about it now,” Marcy murmured, brushing Bonnie’s hair back and kissing her earlobe.

“Yesss,” she purred, tilting her head back as Marcy kissed down her neck. “I’m imagining them sitting across from us, getting more and more turned on until they start touching themselves. Sam squeezing her tits. Amy with a hand down her shorts. Both of them staring at us.”

“That _is_ hot.”

“Mm-hmm. But I don’t want to keep thinking about them. I want you to do what you were telling me about.”

“I thought you’d never ask.”

Giggling, Marcy pulled Bonnie’s top over her head and pushed her down on the bed. Her laughter turned to quiet moans as Marcy settled her weight between her thighs, grinding against her as they kissed.

Marcy shifted downward, trailing kisses. She took Bonnie’s breasts in her hands and pulled a nipple into her mouth, rolling the other between her fingers. Bonnie gasped and squirmed.

Shifting to the other breast, Marcy looked up, meeting Bonnie’s desire-filled eyes. As she moved her tongue in lazy circles, Bonnie moaned and dropped her head back onto the pillow, savoring the sensation.

After a minute, Bonnie wrapped her legs around her and pulled her back up into a kiss. Marcy ground against her pelvis, making her squeal. Frantically, Bonnie tugged at the black fabric of Marcy’s shirt, pulling it up. Marcy helped remove it and pulled Bonnie’s face into her cleavage. The blonde moaned happily, kissing and squeezing Marcy’s breasts through her bra.

Slowly, teasingly, Marcy moved back down Bonnie’s body, kissing her chest and stomach until finally reaching the waistband of her shorts. Bonnie nodded eagerly and lifted her hips to let Marcy pull them off, revealing polka-dot panties.

Dropping the shorts on the floor, Marcy kissed along Bonnie’s thigh, stopping just short of her underwear to tease her, then getting to her feet and shimmying out of her lounge pants. Bonnie grunted in frustration and followed, dropping to her knees to kiss Marcy’s hips. Marcy gasped as Bonnie buried her face between her thighs, pressing into the fabric of her underwear. She felt a surge of lust and pulled Bonnie back up, kissing her deeply. Bonnie giggled and allowed herself to be pushed back down on the bed, pulling Marcy with her.

She gasped and eagerly spread her legs as Marcy kissed slowly down her front to her hips. As promised, Marcy pulled down the fabric just far enough to brush her lips over Bonnie’s cleft. She made eye contact, the elastic straining under her chin as she kissed lower, nuzzling her nose into the triangle of well-trimmed hair, and flicking her tongue out.

“Oh!” Bonnie gasped, running her fingers through Marcy’s hair. She rolled her hips, trying to adjust the angle, but her panties were in the way. Marcy’s eyes gleamed, and she kept teasing her mercilessly.

“Please,” Bonnie begged, gripping her hair tighter, and grinding against her chin. “Please, take them off.”

“Well, since you asked so nicely,” Marcy purred as she backed up on her knees, pulling the panties with her, before crawling seductively up to kiss her deeply. Bonnie moaned around her tongue and wrapped her legs around Marcy’s ass, trying to pull her tighter.

Then Marcy was moving down again, kissing and licking as she went. She could tell Bonnie was excited, squeezing her breasts and squirming as she anticipated what came next. Finally, Marcy settled between her spread legs, licking slowly up her thigh, teasing her before moving inward.

“Oh yes,” Bonnie purred, pinching her nipples as Marcy finally reached her goal, pushing her tongue between her girlfriend’s lips. Eagerly, she lapped up Bonnie’s creamy arousal before rolling her tongue into a tube and licking deeper.

“Oh my god, yes,” Bonnie moaned, rocking back and forth as Marcy fucked her with her tongue. “My clit, ah! Please lick my clit.”

Marcy moved up to trace tight circles around the erect bud. She slipped one, and then two fingers inside Bonnie’s pussy. She was moaning and panting, squirming and tensing, tangling her fingers in Marcy’s hair.

“Oh my god! Yeah, right there, just like that!” Bonnie tightened her grip, pulling more urgently. Marcy curled her fingers, beckoning Bonnie’s orgasm as she arched her back, thrusting her pelvis against Marcy’s face.

“Oh, oh fuck, I’m cumming!” Bonnie groaned as her pussy clenched around Marcy’s fingers over and over, until she collapsed back on the pillow, gasping for breath.

Slowly, Marcy worked her way up, kissing and licking, before rolling onto her back, pulling Bonnie on top, into a passionate kiss. Their tongues danced, and Bonnie moaned with pleasure at the taste of her own cum on Marcy’s lips.

“God, you’re so fucking sexy,” Bonnie growled. Marcy arched her back to pull off her sports bra, eagerly tossing it to the floor. She moaned as Bonnie pulled her breast into her mouth. The blonde looked up at her with eyes full of desire, lips locked around her nipple.

“You look so fucking hot like that,” Marcy purred. She rocked her hips, pushing upwards against Bonnie’s weight between her legs. “But take my underwear off, I want to feel you—ah!” She gasped as Bonnie immediately shimmied lower, rubbing and kissing through her panties. Her hot breath on the damp fabric made Marcy squirm.

“Bonnie, please,” she begged, until Bonnie took pity and hooked fingers under her waistband and pulled them down. She wasted no time, practically diving back between Marcy’s thighs, licking and kissing and rubbing.

“Oh fuck, that feels so good, babe!” Marcy was already groaning and tense, running her fingers through Bonnie’s hair, and pulling her closer. She realized that the long day of teasing had kept her on the edge, and her first orgasm was fast approaching.

“Oh my god, yeah,” she gasped, squeezing her breast as she rocked in place, grinding her pussy against Bonnie’s face. “Fuck, you’re gonna make me cum in your mouth so hard.” Bonnie moaned eagerly, thrusting her tongue deeper.

“Ah! Ah! Ah! Oh my god!” Marcy’s entire body tensed. She felt a release, and Bonnie squealed wetly. Waves of sensation rolled through her body, radiating from her core. Flares of color erupted behind her closed eyes as she rocked in place, holding Bonnie against her, until with a shudder, she pushed her away.

“You have such a tasty pussy,” Bonnie giggled, wiping her chin as she sat back on her knees. Marcy could only breathe, shivering as the aftershocks rolled down her spine. She purred as she felt Bonnie moving up, swinging one leg over her hip to scissor her.

“What are you doing?” Marcy laughed, then let out a satisfied sigh as Bonnie pressed against her.

“I wanna try this,” Bonnie giggled.

“Come on—ah,” Marcy gasped as Bonnie started moving. “No one actually does this, it’s just a porn thing.”

“Says you,” Bonnie replied, a thoughtful expression on her face as she shifted, trying to find the right angle. “Just let me try, I’m curious.”

“It—oh!—It does feel nice, I guess,” Marcy conceded as their lips glided against each other. “I’m still all sensitive.”

“Yeah, you came so fast, babe.”

“It’s—oooh—it’s your fault, you kept me so turned on all day.”

“Here, like this,” Bonnie mumbled, grabbing one of Marcy’s legs and pulling it up onto her shoulder. “Oh, that feels good.” She held Marcy’s ankle and began grinding more urgently, thrusting against her.

“Mmm, I like it when you rub your pussy on my clit like that.”

“Not—ah!—Not bad for a porn move, huh?”

“Shut up, just—ooh—just keep doing that,” Marcy groaned.

“Roll your hips, babe, move like this.”

“Like this?”

“Yeah! Fuck yeah. Oh! This is going to make me cum…”

“Do it, cum all over my pussy,” Marcy urged.

“Oh! Oh. Uh. Ah!” Bonnie’s staccato gasping increased as she leaned into Marcy’s upright leg, rolling her hips, grinding and rubbing. Everything was slick and juicy and hot and sensitive.

“Come on, do it. Cum for me. Cum _on_ me,” Marcy moaned.

“Ah! Ah! Ah! Oh… Fuck!” Bonnie cried out as she went rigid, then swore as her knee slipped, and she fell off the bed with a crash.

“Bon!” Marcy yelped, rolling over. “Are you okay? Did you hurt yourself?”

“Just my pride,” Bonnie groaned. She was sprawled on the floor, rubbing her elbow. “Fucking porn makes it look so easy.”

Marcy stifled a giggle, but Bonnie met her eyes and they both started laughing. She climbed off the bed and pulled Bonnie into a hug. They held each other, laughing at the absurdity of the situation.

Suddenly, there was a knock at the door.

“Quick,” Bonnie hissed, “Get in the other bed!”

Frantically, they both dove into opposite beds, pulling the covers up just as the door opened to reveal Coach Sam. Marcy buried her face in the pillow, praying the dim moonlight was too dark for Sam to recognize her.

“Girls, I know you’re excited, but you’ve got to go to sleep. I need you up and ready to rock first thing in the morning, okay?”

Stunned, they could only mumble in agreement.

“Alright. Get some good rest.”

Sam closed the door and they heard her footsteps moving away.

“Oh. My. God,” Bonnie whispered.

“Holy shit,” Marcy agreed, sitting up.

“Like, just for a second, I thought maybe she was here to, uh…”

“To watch?” Marcy snickered.

“Yes! Like, we were _just_ talking about it, and then she shows up right when I’m about to cum?”

“I can’t believe she didn’t notice it was me instead of Amy.”

“I can,” Bonnie giggled and sat up, throwing her blanket aside. “Did you see her shirt?”

“No, I had my face hidden in the pillow. What about it?”

“The buttons were done up wrong and it looked like her bra was unhooked.”

“You don’t think…?”

“Oh yeah. Her hair was messed up, too. I bet she was getting lucky with Coach Jake when she came to see what the noise was.”

“With Jake? Ew.” Marcy crossed over to sit next to Bonnie, who shrugged.

“He’s cute enough for a guy. And he clearly thinks she’s great.”

“Whatever. Gross.”

“Alright, alright,” Bonnie chuckled. “What would you rather talk about?”

“Well,” Marcy considered, leaning in and kissing her neck. “You said you were about to cum before you fell over?”

“Yeah,” Bonnie purred. “I was so close. Your pussy felt really good on mine. But you know what I really want?”

“What?”

“Your fingers again.”

“Then turn around,” Marcy replied. Bonnie turned away and dropped onto her hands and knees. Marcy moved behind her, running her hands over her hips and ass. Bonnie arched her back to give Marcy better access and gasped as two fingers dipped inside.

“Oh yeah,” she purred, reaching between her legs to rub her clit. Marcy started moving in and out, coating her fingers in Bonnie’s wetness. She quickly increased her tempo, and Bonnie matched her pace.

“Oh my god,” she gasped. “Fuck, that feels so good, babe.”

“Yeah?” Marcy felt her fingers being squeezed. “You like getting fucked from behind?” Bonnie squealed as Marcy slapped her ass, squeezing and spreading her cheeks as she kept fucking her.

“Oh fuck, you’re gonna make me cum again,” Bonnie moaned into the pillow. “Oh! Oh my god!” She started shaking, her insides clenching as her fingers rubbed tight, urgent circles around her clit.

“Oh right there, right there, OH MY GOD, FUUUCK,” Bonnie screamed, muffled by the pillow. Marcy grinned and kept her fingers in place until Bonnie pulled away, still squirming and panting.

“Fucking hell, babe, that was so good,” Bonnie gasped, turning and kissing her. Marcy laughed and let herself be pushed onto her back. Bonnie grinned at her and moved to throw her leg over Marcy’s head in a 69 position.

Marcy gasped as Bonnie immediately started licking her clit. She responded in kind, wrapping her lips around Bonnie’s sensitive bud and sucking. Bonnie squealed and pushed her tongue into between Marcy’s lips. They went back and forth, distracting each other, seeing who could focus more. Marcy slapped Bonnie’s ass, and she responded by slipping her thumb into Marcy’s pussy. She gasped at the sudden intrusion, and grabbed Bonnie’s ass with both hands, spreading her cheeks and sucking on her clit. She lost her focus when she felt Bonnie easing a slender finger into her ass.

“Oh my god,” Marcy groaned, feeling Bonnie’s thumb and finger separated by only a thin bridge of sensitive flesh. “Fuck, yeah, oh god.” She slapped Bonnie’s ass, hard, making her squeal into her clit, but she didn’t relent, and Marcy felt her insides beginning to clench around Bonnie’s digits. She lifted her head, burying her face in her girlfriend’s wetness, but immediately dropped back down, gasping as she felt the pressure building.

“Oh, you’re making me cum!” She squeezed Marcy’s ass and squirmed, rocking her hips, fucking against her fingers. Marcy was saying something, urging her on, but she couldn’t hear. She was only aware of the stimulation between her legs, the tongue lashing her clit, the pressure of their bodies against each other.

“Yeah, yeah, oh, oh, oh god, oh fuck,” Marcy cried into Bonnie’s thigh. “Fuck me, fuck me, fuck me!” Fireworks were going off inside her brain. Lightning crackled through her nervous system. She came long and hard until she collapsed. Bonnie moved to snuggle up at her side, resting her head on Marcy’s shoulder and kissing her cheek.

They lay together like that for a long time, kissing and caressing each other.

They were both afraid to be the first to admit the inevitable fact that they couldn’t stay together all night.

Finally, Marcy did it.

“I should go.”

“Nooo,” Bonnie protested sleepily. “Stay.”

“I can’t. Amy could come back anytime.”

“I don’t care.”

“Well, she’d tell Coach Sam, and she’d care.”

“Hmmph,” Bonnie seemed to concede the point.

Reluctantly, Marcy stood up and gathered her scattered clothes. After pulling on her pants and shirt, she leaned over to kiss Bonnie goodnight.

“Hmm, you taste like sex,” Bonnie purred.

“So do you, babe.” Marcy kissed her again and then went to the door.

Slowly, she cracked it open. Just as she was about to step into the hall, she saw movement. Peeking out, she saw Rylie and Ian come down the hall. Rylie’s top was unbuttoned and billowed to reveal her bare breasts. Ian followed a step behind, and it took her a moment to realize she wasn’t holding his hand, but instead was pulling him eagerly down the hall by his erect cock.

Blinking in surprise, she watched as Rylie led Ian to the door of the room she and Marcy shared, pulling him in after her. He had a dopey, horny expression on his face, and it was obvious they would be fucking as soon as the door was closed.

Which meant she couldn’t go back to her room. Grinning, she closed the door and took her clothes back off.

“Good news, babe,” she whispered as she slipped back under the blanket. “I’m staying here.”

“Yaaay,” Bonnie whispered, snuggling up to her. “Why?”

“I just saw Rylie, and you’ll never believe who she was with.”

“Never mind,” Bonnie said drowsily. “Tell me in the morning.”

“Love you, Bon-bon.”

“Love you too,” she mumbled, already falling back asleep.
