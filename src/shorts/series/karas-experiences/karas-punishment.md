Fidgeting with her keys, Kara hesitated at the front door of her girlfriend’s apartment. No, scratch that. Victoria always frowned when Kara said, “girlfriend.” She said the word was “used by the patriarchy to demean relationships between women.” But she also resisted any attempt to find a better term to define their relationship, so Kara found herself falling back on the word that most people understood.

They’d met at a party hosted by the campus LGBT+ community group. Kara had worked up the nerve to walk in, but found herself being a wallflower. Despite an experience the year before that boosted her confidence and resulted in a sexual awakening, she still struggled with social anxiety. Victoria spotted her from the dance floor and beckoned her over, kickstarting a passionate romance. They’d been together ever since.

However, there was an extra layer to their relationship beyond simple intimacy. Victoria said she saw a spark in Kara that was at risk of being smothered by “Western society’s restrictive Puritan social norms.” She’d appointed herself Kara’s mentor, determined to broaden her sexual horizons and push her limits.

Mostly, this took the form of exciting challenges, meant to expand her comfort zone, each building on the last. Bold makeup choices led to shorter skirts, lower-cut tops, and eventually going to class with no underwear. Leaving the lights on when they fooled around turned into filming themselves having sex. And what started with kissing in public ultimately led to Kara going down on her in a movie theater. Each challenge was thrilling and nerve-wracking in equal measure.

Now, Victoria was waiting inside, and Kara was nervous because, for the first time, she’d failed a challenge. Victoria had sent her to class with a remote-controlled vibrator and clear instructions not to cum. But Kara couldn’t do it. Victoria’s remote stimulation had become too intense, and she ran out of the lecture hall before she had a very obvious public orgasm.

How would Victoria respond? Surely, she’d be disappointed, but then what would happen? Would she comfort Kara and apologize for pushing her too far? That seemed unlikely. Maybe she would shrug and give up on the challenges, leaving Kara forever wondering what could have happened next. Or, worst of all, what if she decided that Kara was just too boring and vanilla to waste any more time on, and broke up with her?

Taking a deep breath to steady herself, she unlocked the door and slipped inside, hanging her bag on the coat rack and dropping her keys on the table before looking up.

Victoria was leaning casually against the kitchen doorframe, sipping a glass of whiskey. Her relaxed pose contrasted with her severe appearance. Hair pulled back in a tight ponytail. Dark lipstick, thigh-high fishnets, and a black mesh thong. All topped with a leather corset that barely contained her breasts. Despite her nervousness, Kara felt a surge of excitement. Victoria only dressed like this when she wanted to take charge in the bedroom. She’d clearly been expecting Kara to come home desperately aroused.

“So,” Victoria asked calmly, “how’d it go?”

“I couldn’t do it,” Kara stammered, twisting her hands.

“I figured,” Victoria nodded, walking over to the couch. “When I saw the app disconnect. But tell me about it. What went wrong?” She sat in the middle, crossed her legs, and draped her arms across the back, pointedly not inviting Kara to sit beside her. She didn’t seem upset, but there was something about her body language that made Kara alert.

“Um, at first, it was exciting? I could barely focus on the lecture, but I thought I could hold out. I kept peeking around to make sure no one knew what I was doing. When you put it on that escalating pattern, it was _so_ distracting. The intensity would build and build, and when it reset, I was gripping the edge of my seat.”

Victoria took another slow sip and nodded for Kara to continue.

“But then it started to be too much. Every time it peaked, it was all I could do not to moan and squirm in my seat. I was so wet, it was soaking through my skirt. I was worried the girl sitting next to me could smell how turned on I was.”

“Is that when you turned it off?”

“No! I didn’t want to give up, even though I was worried about losing control. But then you turned it up again! I didn’t think it could even go any higher. I was starting to breathe heavily and squeeze my thighs together. I was desperate not to lose control. I kept thinking about you saying, ‘Be a good girl, and don’t cum.’”

“And did you?”

“No, but I realized I wasn’t going to make it. There were still fifteen minutes of class left! I was so frustrated, I was almost crying.” The words were spilling out of her as she desperately tried to make Victoria understand. “I know if you’d been there… If you had been able to see me, you would have turned it down. You wouldn’t have made me cum in front of everyone. You wanted me to be on the edge, right? So I could come home to you. You can’t have wanted me to lose control. I know you didn’t want to humiliate me in front of the entire class. Because if I had started to cum, I wouldn’t have been able to stop. I would have been moaning and humping my chair. People would have laughed and stared, but I wouldn’t have been able to stop. That _can’t_ be what you wanted, right?”

“Hmm.” Victoria paused for a long moment, considering the idea. “No, I suppose not. Not yet.”

Kara’s eyes opened wide with surprise. Not yet? How far did Victoria intend to take her?

“Anyway,” Victoria shrugged, “what did you do then?”

“When I realized I couldn’t stop it from happening, I grabbed my bag and ran to the bathroom. I barely made it. As soon as I closed the stall door, my orgasm hit. All I could do was brace myself on the wall and try not to make any noise. I came so hard, it was running down my leg and dripping on the floor. When I was finally able to pull the egg out, it was so slippery I almost dropped it, trying to find the off switch.”

“How did you feel?”

“Incredible! Breathless. Flushed. Nervous?”

“Do you think,” Victoria mused, “that your orgasm was more intense because it started in public?”

“Um,” Kara blushed. “Yes?”

“Well, that’s something, I suppose.”

Kara sighed, flooded with relief. She understood!

“But, you _did_ break your word, didn’t you?” Victoria raised an eyebrow. “You promised to be a good girl. To hold yourself back from cumming.”

A confusing thrill of anticipation rolled down Kara’s spine.

“And, if a _good_ girl would have controlled herself, I suppose that makes you a _bad_ girl, doesn’t it?”

Kara slowly nodded.

“So, if a good girl gets a reward, what do you think a bad girl should get?”

“A punishment?” Kara could barely breathe the answer.

“Interesting.” Victoria smiled. “To start, why don’t you undress.”

Feeling weak in the knees, but undeniably curious, Kara dutifully removed her clothes. Victoria watched over the rim of her whiskey glass as Kara folded her things and set them neatly aside. When she finished, Victoria gestured for her to kneel.

“That’s better,” she said. “I like the way you look, naked on the floor. Eager to please. You’re excited, aren’t you? Desperate to make it up to me. And you should be, because you derailed my plans for you tonight.”

Kara’s eyes involuntarily flicked toward the bedroom. She blushed, imagining what Victoria would have done if she’d come home as planned, panting with desire and desperate for release.

“Well, another time, perhaps,” Victoria shrugged. “Right now, I have a more pressing concern. You’re not the only one who spent the afternoon getting excited, but you’re the only one who’s had any release. That doesn’t seem fair, does it?”

Kara shook her head as Victoria spread her legs.

“Come see the state you’ve left me in.”

Surprised at how much this new dynamic excited her, Kara crawled forward on her hands and knees. As she approached, Victoria ran her fingers through Kara’s hair, grabbing a handful and pulling her closer. The smell of Victoria’s arousal filled her nostrils as she pressed her nose into the damp gusset of her thong.

“Look what you did,” she growled. “It’s hardly fair for you to get off without me and then leave me like this. Go on, lick it. I want you to taste how excited I was for you to come home so I could reward you.”

Kara dragged her tongue over the fabric, already clinging to Victoria’s lips. Her juices seeped through, teasing Kara with the taste of her lover’s arousal. She moaned with desperation, to be so close, but still separated.

“Frustrating, isn’t it?” Victoria groaned. “That’s how I felt, seeing you stroll through the front door, glowing with satisfaction.”

“I’m sorry,” Kara murmured from between her thighs. “Let me make it up to you.”

“Since you’re so eager to redeem yourself, I’ll allow you to remove my underwear… with your teeth.”

Eagerly, Kara bit the waistband and started pulling down. Victoria lifted her hips a bit, but otherwise let Kara struggle. The process was awkward and demeaning, but at last, she knelt between Victoria’s knees with the thong hanging from her lips. Triumphant, she tossed it carelessly aside.

“Well done,” Victoria said, dipping a finger between her labia, glistening with arousal. “Don’t you look pleased with yourself? Like a puppy, desperate for approval.” She laughed. “Come here, puppy, here’s a treat for you.”

She offered her wet finger, and Kara gratefully wrapped her lips around it.

“Do you want more? Then go down on me. If you do a good job, I may be generous with your punishment.”

Kara didn’t need any more encouragement. Without hesitation, she buried her face between Victoria’s thighs. Her tongue danced between slick lips to lap up her lover’s juices. Victoria let out a long sigh and relaxed as she took another sip of whiskey.

“That’s it, puppy. Just like I taught you.”

A warm glow of pride flared inside when Victoria praised her. Kara moved her head in circles, working her tongue deeper. She worshipped Victoria’s pussy, wanting desperately to make her feel good. When she felt the grip on her hair tighten, she shivered with pleasure.

“Use your fingers.”

Kara slipped two inside, and wrapped her lips around Victoria’s clit. She felt the thighs around her head tense, and curled her fingers in a come-hither motion. Her lover grunted and lifted her hips, grinding against Kara’s face.

“Don’t. Stop.” Victoria said through clenched teeth.

Kara hummed with satisfaction, working her fingers and tongue in a rhythm. Victoria was squirming and bucking her hips. Slowly, Kara extended her pinky finger. Victoria had spent many hours teaching Kara how to please her, but this was something Kara had discovered all on her own. When Victoria was this turned on, a finger in her ass set her off like a firework.

Victoria grunted as Kara’s knuckle bumped against her back door. She tensed as Kara worked her fingertip into the tight opening. And, as always, Victoria gasped as she suddenly unclenched, letting Kara slip it all the way in.

“Oh, fuck me!”

Kara worked harder, thrusting her fingers deeper. The grip on her hair tightened as she flicked her tongue faster. They both moaned as Victoria’s climax approached, her insides clenching and squeezing.

Kara didn’t stop until Victoria suddenly cried out, arching her back. Hot fluid gushed around her fingers, dripping down her arm onto the floor. She held still, letting Victoria’s body react to the steady pressure, until at last, she shuddered and swatted her away.

Kara rocked back on her heels, gasping for breath and wiping her lover’s juices from her chin. Victoria had curled tightly into a ball, shivering as the final waves of pleasure rolled over her. After a minute, she relaxed, then stretched wide and sat up.

“Alright, puppy,” she chuckled, seeing Kara’s triumphant expression. “That was nicely done. Because you worked so hard to please me, I’m feeling generous.” She tapped a finger on her lower lip, thinking. “I’m only going to spank you fifteen times, instead of thirty.”

“What? A spanking?”

Victoria laughed at the shocked expression on Kara’s face. “What sort of punishment were you expecting?”

“I don’t know. Not that!”

“What, you thought going down on me was your punishment?”

“I mean, kinda?”

“No, no, no. You enjoyed it too much.”

Kara cheeks burned and she looked away. She felt foolish. Victoria put a finger under her chin and pulled her gently back.

“Come on, puppy, have you never been spanked?”

“No! My parents didn’t believe in it!”

“That explains a lot,” Victoria smirked.

“Doesn’t it hurt?”

“It wouldn’t be a good punishment if it didn’t hurt a little,” Victoria shrugged. “But some people find the boundary between pain and pleasure is a bit… hazy.”

Kara frowned. Victoria leaned closer, until their lips were nearly touching.

“Do you trust me?”

“…Yes?”

“Have I ever gone too far with you?”

“No,” Kara conceded.

“Then trust me now. If it’s too much, you can say, hmm… ‘Pineapple,’ and I’ll stop.”

“Yeah?”

“Yeah.” At last, Victoria pulled her into a kiss so full of desire it left her light-headed. “Now, bend over my knee like a _good girl_, and accept your punishment.”

Nervously, Kara got into position. It was awkward, being on her hands and knees over Victoria’s legs on the couch. Her heart pounded wildly with anticipation. Victoria grinned wolfishly, caressing her bare bottom.

_Slap!_ “One.”

Kara jumped as the first slap impacted her ass, hard enough to leave a stinging impression behind.

_Slap!_ “Two.”

The second fell on her other cheek, just as shocking as the first.

_Slap!_ “Three.”

Kara whimpered as Victoria slapped the first cheek again, intensifying the sensation.

_Slap!_ “Four.”

Her soft flesh rippled from the impact. She curled her spine, flinching away from the blows. She wanted to cover her rear to protect herself, but knew she couldn’t.

_Slap!_ “Five.”

She gasped from the sharp pain. Ten more? She wouldn’t be able to sit when this was over.

Victoria paused for a moment, caressing her ass softly. Kara shivered as cool fingers slipped down the back of her leg, and teased back up her inner thigh. When they met her vulva, she gasped as Victoria dragged one finger teasingly between her lips, slick with arousal.

She felt humiliated by how wet and ready she was, remembering Victoria saying she might like the confusing mix of pleasure and pain. She wanted to protest, but also desperately wanted her to keep touching her like this.

_Slap!_ “Six.”

Kara cried out in shock. She’d known there were more slaps coming, but the tender touch between her thighs had sent a confusing mix of pleasure to soothe the stinging. Now, pain flared back to the forefront.

_Slap!_ “Seven.”

She bit her lip, choking back a sob as conflicted emotions swirled in her brain.

_Slap!_ “Eight.”

Squinting her eyes tight, she saw flares of white sparks behind her eyelids. She gripped the edge of the couch cushion tightly.

_Slap!_ “Nine.”

“Fuck!” she blurted, clamping a hand over her mouth.

_Slap!_ “Ten.”

She swore into her hand, trying not to focus on the burning heat on her bottom.

When Victoria’s fingers again teased between her legs and caressed her lips, she gasped with surprise. The gentle touch stood in stark contrast to the harsh spanking. She rocked back against Victoria’s hand, desperate for more, and whimpered when she pulled away too soon.

_Slap!_ “Eleven.”

Kara sobbed with frustration at the sudden flare of incandescent pain. A tear rolled down her cheek.

_Slap!_ “Twelve.”

_Pineapple!_ The word was right on her lips. All she had to do was say it, and Victoria would stop.

_Slap!_ “Thirteen.”

But confusingly, some part of her didn’t want it to stop. She buried her face in the couch cushion and groaned, bracing herself for the next blow.

_Slap!_ “Fourteen.”

She shouted into the couch cushion, confused by her body’s reaction, and anticipating the final spank.

It didn’t come.

She growled with frustration. Without intending to, she arched her back, presenting herself, waggling her ass as if begging Victoria to finish the job.

_SLAP!_ “Fifteen.”

The final slap was the hardest of all, falling on stinging, burning, tender flesh. Her body rippled around the blow, and a breath she didn’t realize she’d been holding burst out of her in a shuddering release.

“Good job, puppy, you took your punishment well.”

Kara moaned and squirmed, unable to process the praise. Her body was aflame with a terrible mixture of pain and arousal. She arched her back again, desperate for Victoria’s touch, the gentle caress that had followed each round of spanking.

“Please,” she gasped.

“Please, what?” Victoria murmured, while running a fingertip up the back of Kara’s thigh, making her shiver with desire.

“Please, make me cum,” she begged shamelessly, no longer embarrassed by how turned-on she was. “I’m so close.”

“Well, since you asked so nicely,” Victoria chuckled. Kara didn’t hear her, as a hand moved up her thigh and fingers slipped between her lips.

She rolled her hips, urgently rocking back and forth against Victoria’s expert stimulation. She was on fire. Every sensation was bleeding into the others, an overwhelming cocktail of stimulation.

“Cum for me, puppy.”

Kara screamed as her body responded immediately to the command. Her insides clenched tightly around thrusting fingers. She rolled her hips against the pressure on her clit, waves of pleasure radiating out from her core. Behind her closed eyes, fireworks of pink and yellow erupted.

In the end, the release left her limp and breathless. It took effort to sit up, and curl herself into her lover’s embrace. Victoria held her close, pulling her head onto her shoulder, caressing her back, and whispering, “Good girl” until she stopped shivering.

“Maybe next time,” Victoria mused, with a smile on her face, “I’ll sneak into your class and sit in the back, so I can see how close you get to the edge.”
