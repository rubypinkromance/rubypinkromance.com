Kara’s heart pounded as she sat perfectly still in her seat, trying to ignore the vibrator rumbling insistently inside her. The art history lecture hall was dimly lit for a slideshow, but the other students sitting around her would definitely notice if she started squirming. She bit her lip and gripped her pen tighter. She’d given up on taking notes, but hoped that holding the pen made it less obvious the state she was in.

Before she’d left for classes that morning, her girlfriend Victoria had inspected her outfit, walking in a slow circle, assessing her choices. The polka-dot skirt was one of Victoria’s favorites, and she’d paired it with a simple pink button-up and Converse. “You look nice,” Victoria concluded. Before Kara could breathe a sigh of relief, she added, “but undo two more buttons and give me your panties.”

Victoria had a knack for pushing Kara just outside her comfort zone, giving her permission to explore a more sensual side of herself. It started with little challenges like choosing a bolder shade of lipstick, or secretly wearing exciting lingerie under her clothes. Then, between classes, Victoria would summon her to an isolated stairwell for an illicit rendezvous that would leave her breathless and flushed. Today, she was sending her out in a short skirt with no underwear and her top unbuttoned scandalously low.

Her first class was thrilling. She sat with her group, discussing their project like normal. The guys struggled not to stare down her shirt, which made her nipples harden and her heart beat faster. Of course, they couldn’t tell she wasn’t wearing any underwear, and that secret made her even more excited. She found herself leaning forward, daring them to look, and reveling in their desire.

After that, Victoria met her in the student union building for lunch. When she raised an eyebrow suggestively and asked how class went, Kara blushed. After confirming no one was listening, she confessed everything. How the attention had secretly excited her, how she’d encouraged the boys to peek. Victoria nodded approvingly.

“Come with me. I’ve got a present for you.”

With that, she threw away her sandwich, took Kara by the hand, and led her to the restroom. In the last stall, Victoria pressed her against the wall and kissed her passionately. Kara melted into her arms, desperate for her touch. One hand slipped into her shirt to rub her nipple. Another traced up her inner thigh, reaching under her skirt. She gasped as Victoria’s nimble fingers danced over her lips, finding her wet and ready. When they finally dipped inside, Kara moaned around Victoria’s tongue.

Only when she was panting with desire did Victoria step back, and take the present out of her bag. The object she produced was bright pink and shaped like an egg with a long tail. When Kara looked confused, she explained.

“Since you like having a sexy secret in public, you’ll love this. The big end is a vibrator. Here, spread your legs.” Kara did as she was told, stifling a squeak as Victoria reached under her skirt and pressed it against her slick lips. “That’s right, baby, let me put it in you. Ah! There it goes, and the tail hangs out like that. Now, here’s the clever part.”

Victoria pulled out her phone and touched the screen. Kara jumped as the egg suddenly buzzed to life. She clamped her hands between her legs and stared wide-eyed at Victoria as she dragged her finger up and down on her phone, the intensity of the vibration changing to match.

“Do you like it? It’s remote-controlled. I can change the pattern and the intensity from anywhere.” She leaned closer, brushing her lips against Kara’s. “Now, you’ll go to your next class…”

“Class?” Kara shook her head. “No, no, no, I can’t do that in public!”

“Your next class is art history, right? In that dark lecture hall?” When Kara nodded, Victoria smiled. “See? That’s perfect. You’ll sit there in the dark with this vibrating away inside you. I’m going back to the apartment, and I’m going to keep you right on the edge the whole time. No one will be able to tell. And when class is over, you’ll come… home to me.”

Kara gasped at the thought. Even when Victoria pushed her boundaries, she’d learned to trust one thing about these challenges. If she did what was asked, and shared all the details of how it made her feel, Victoria would reward her. Her heart beat faster as she imagined falling into bed with her after sitting through an entire class with a vibrator inside.

“One rule,” Victoria breathed, nibbling on her earlobe. “Under no circumstances are you allowed to cum. You save that for _me_. I want you to ride the edge of this experience and then come home to me. Can you do that? Can you control yourself? Can you be a _good girl_ for me?”

That was all it took, really. Victoria knew her too well. When she said “Good girl” like that, it sent a shiver straight down Kara’s spine. She nodded helplessly. Victoria kissed her, smiled devilishly, and slipped out. Kara was left breathless and disheveled, with only a few minutes to pull herself together for class. The egg continued gently vibrating the whole time, discreet but impossible to ignore.

The first half hour of class wasn’t too difficult. She claimed a seat near the back, and avoided making eye contact with anyone she knew. The other seats slowly filled, and when the lights dimmed, she breathed a sigh of relief. At first, she could almost ignore the sensation, but after a bit, it started to change. Victoria must have started playing with the controls. The vibrations grew more insistent, until the rumbling was all she could think about.

Licking her lips, Kara glanced around the art history lecture hall, confirming once again that no one was looking at her. Everyone else was lost in their thoughts. Some were paying attention to the slides and diligently taking notes. Some were slouched low, looking at their phones. One guy had actually fallen asleep. His friend nudged him when he started snoring, and he sat up, blinking blearily.

No one else seemed to have spent the last half-hour trying to ignore their growing arousal. _Slow your breathing_, she told herself. _No one knows. They can’t hear the vibrator. Try to look like you’re paying attention to the lecture. Something about… Impressionism?_ She squeezed her legs tightly together, resisting the urge to squirm in her seat.

The egg’s vibration wasn’t as intense as holding a vibrator to her clit, but it simply never stopped. No matter how she shifted her weight, or crossed or uncrossed her legs, the rumbling in her core continued. The stimulation was diffuse but pervasive. She felt it everywhere, and the longer it went on, the more her body responded.

Victoria had set it on a pattern that seemed designed to be as distracting as possible. It started as a low and slow rumble, gradually building to a powerfully intense buzzing, before abruptly dropping back to the lowest setting. The cycle repeated until Kara could only grip her desk with white knuckles, trying desperately not to make any noise.

She imagined Victoria, back at her apartment, manipulating the controls. She would have changed already. When she was in the mood to play with Kara, she always put on a leather corset that barely contained her breasts, and pulled her hair back in a severe ponytail. Would she be in bed already, or sitting on the couch? Probably the couch. Sitting there, legs crossed, casually holding her phone, playing with the intensity, and enjoying the effect she was having from afar.

Kara shot a desperate look at the clock. Class wouldn’t end for another twenty minutes. Could she last that long? As if in response to her thought, the pattern changed to an intense, steady vibration. Oh, God! It was taking all her willpower not to react.

What had started as a pleasant secret had grown to a distracting arousal and continued from there. The pressure had been building, and now she felt an undeniable need for release. She was grateful no one could see the flush across her chest. Her nipples ached to be touched. Her insides squeezed around the egg, rippling with anticipation.

_Focus on the slides_, she told herself. _Don’t think about how desperately you need to cum._ The teacher’s droning voice was explaining Monet’s exile in London, but the intense, all-consuming vibration deep in her core drove away all other thoughts.

She released a shuddering breath and slowly rocked forward in her seat, changing the pressure on her clit. Her fingernails dug into the paper of her notebook as she struggled not to give in. Victoria said she had to control herself. She had to be good. Just hold out a bit longer.

The pressure inside continued to build, along with her fear of losing control. Desperate to hold back the tide, she discreetly hiked her skirt high enough to slip her hand under. Spreading her legs just enough to clamp her hand between her thighs, applying a firm, reassuring pressure, she shivered, feeling her lips puffy and wet under her fingers. Her juices were literally dripping down the tail of the vibrator, soaking into the back of her skirt. If this got much worse, she was going to leave an actual puddle on the seat.

A jolt of electricity crackled up her spine, nearly making her jump, as Victoria turned up the intensity again. She stifled a sob of frustration. It hadn’t already been on the highest setting? Her insides fluttered, rippling around the intense stimulation, desperate for release.

Class _must_ be almost over. She looked desperately at the clock, hoping to see only a minute or two left, but there were still _fifteen_ minutes to go! Oh, fuck. She gripped her desk tighter as she realized she wasn’t going to make it. Victoria couldn’t see her. She didn’t understand how desperate the situation was. If she were here, surely she would lower the intensity to keep Kara on the edge.

She shuddered, feeling an orgasm starting to bubble up. It was too intense. She couldn’t hold it off. Would Victoria make her cum right here in class? There would be no denying what was happening as she cried out and rocked in place, sobbing in frustration as she came uncontrollably in front of everyone.

That can’t have been what Victoria intended. With a shock, she realized the only alternative was to break her promise. What would the consequences be? She’d never failed a challenge before, but as soon as the thought crossed her mind, she knew she had no choice. Frantically, she stuffed her things into her bag and hurried for the exit.

She didn’t notice if her classmates protested as she scooted past them, praying they couldn’t smell her arousal. She threw open the door and ran down the hall, bumping into several people on her desperate flight to the bathroom. The egg continued its relentless assault, making it clear that if she stopped for even a second, she would lose control.

She just had enough willpower to lock the stall door and throw her bag on the hook before bracing herself on the wall. Standing up, legs spread wide, she gasped as quietly as possible as a relentless climax tore through her. Her knees shook and her vision blurred. She felt hot liquid dripping down her thighs as she thrust her hips. Her insides clenched over and over, waves of pleasure rippling out from her core.

When the sensation receded enough to restore control of her body, she reached under her skirt and yanked the egg out. Once outside her body, the buzzing was embarrassingly loud. Frantically, she felt around the slippery silicone skin for an off switch, finally finding a dimple that shut it down.

Still breathing heavily, she did her best to clean up, praying no one else heard what she’d just done. Wrapping the pink egg in toilet paper, she hid it in her bag and stepped out to wash her hands. In the mirror, she was flushed, but giddy-looking. She grinned at her reflection, and tried to brush her hair back into control. Despite a lingering sense of shame, she had to admit she felt incredible.

Now, she just had to tell Victoria what she’d done.
