It was clear to Julie that nothing would happen unless she got involved. The party wound down a while ago, and everyone had gone home except Alice’s friend Dan. There was chemistry between him and the two roommates, but he seemed reluctant to act on it. Julie could tell that Alice fancied him, but was hesitating because she could also sense a spark between him and Julie. Alice sometimes suffered from limited imagination, Julie thought, as she grabbed three beers from the fridge.

In the living room, Alice was on the couch, telling a story while gesticulating wildly with a now-empty bottle. Dan reclined in the loveseat across from her, laughing and holding a beer he’d already peeled the label from. Julie handed them each a fresh drink and sat down next to Alice.

“Let’s play truth or dare,” she suggested casually when Alice finished talking.

Alice shot her a look that said, “I see what you’re doing,” but didn’t object.

Dan leaned forward. “I’m game. Alice, you start.”

“Um, okay,” Alice smiled. “Dan, truth or dare?”

“Truth”

“Who’s your celebrity crush?”

“Scarlett Johansson.”

Julie rolled her eyes. “Boooooring.”

“Hey, I like her!” Dan protested.

“Everyone _likes_ her,” Julie retorted. “She wears a leather catsuit in comic book movies. Try harder.”

“Fine,” Dan laughed. “Julie, truth or dare?”

“Truth.”

“Who’s _your_ celebrity crush?”

“Jason Momoa,” she purred. “Especially back when he had dreads. But I wouldn’t kick Rihanna out of my bed,” she trailed off. “…Okay, Dan, truth or dare?”

“Truth.”

“Ever fooled around in public?” Julie leaned forward, arching her eyebrows at him.

“Um,” he hesitated, taking a sip of his beer. “I got a BJ in a movie theater once.” He turned to Alice. “Truth or dare?”

“Truth, please.”

“Have you ever gone commando in public?”

“Sometimes in the summer,” Alice said with a smile. “Truth or dare?”

“Truth.”

“Have you…” she hesitated, trying to match the spirit of his question, “ever gone streaking?”

“In high school, my shorts fell off at the pool, and the girl I had a crush on saw me, does that count?”

Alice laughed. “I’ll allow it.”

Dan turned back to Julie and asked, “truth or dare?”

“Truth.”

“What age did you lose your virginity?”

“Sixteen, to a guy on the soccer team. Really nice legs, but surprisingly little stamina.” Alice laughed, and Julie asked her, “truth or dare?”

“Truth.”

“What kind of panties are you wearing?”

Alice shot a nervous glance in Dan’s direction, but answered the question. “A black mesh thong.”

“Nice, date night underwear!” Julie laughed, giving Dan a thumbs-up as Alice blushed.

“Fine, I see how it is,” Alice said with bravado. “Truth or dare?”

“Truth, babe.”

“Describe your bra to Dan.”

“Gladly!” Julie winked at Dan while cupping her breasts. “It’s my favorite, blue satin with lace at the top of the cups. Super cute.” He nodded approvingly, raised his beer to her, and they both took a drink. Julie looked back at Alice. “Truth or dare?”

“Truth.”

“Why don’t you tell Dan,” she said with a knowing grin, “what you wear to sleep?”

“Um,” Alice stammered, “just some shorts and a tank top.”

“That’s a lie,” Julie snorted. “You sleep nak—ow!” She rubbed her arm where Alice had elbowed her. “Dan, truth or dare.”

“Truth.”

“What do you sleep in?”

“Just boxers,” Dan said, clearly still savoring the thought of Alice sleeping naked. “Truth or dare?”

“Truth,” Julie grinned, knowing what was coming.

“What do _you_ sleep in?”

“Alice’s bed, if I’m drunk,” She paused for a moment to savor the surprise on his face. Alice hid her face in her hands and groaned. Ignoring this, Julie leaned conspiratorially towards Dan. “Truth or dare?”

“Uh, truth,” he answered, still trying to decide if she was joking.

“Does that excite you?”

“I mean… yeah,” he nodded. “Yeah, it does. Alice, truth or dare?”

“Truth,” she answered reluctantly.

“Does she really get in your bed?”

Alice let out a long sigh and sat up straighter, as if resolving not to feel embarrassed. “Yes. Now and then. Usually, she just wants to make out a bit, and sometimes…” She looked at Julie, smiling despite herself. “I don’t mind.”

Dan looked like he wanted to ask a million follow-up questions, but instead, he nodded thoughtfully and took a sip of his beer. “Well, alright.”

“Truth or dare?” Alice asked him.

“Truth.”

“Have you ever made out with a roommate?”

“No, I’ve only had male roommates. When they’re drunk, they’re more likely to pass out playing Madden in the living room than climb into my bed.” Dan turned his attention back to Julie. “Truth or dare?”

“Truth,” she grinned, starting to really enjoy herself.

“Drunk roommate make-out sessions aside, have you ever hooked up with a woman?”

“Don’t threaten me with a good time!” They all laughed. “More girls than guys, to be honest.” She waited for Dan to take an awkwardly long sip of his beer and asked, “truth or dare?”

“Truth.”

“Drunk roommate make-out sessions aside,” she echoed his question back to him, “have you ever hooked up with a man?”

“Nah, not my thing.”

“Too bad, guys making out gets Alice hot,” she replied, ducking a pillow Alice threw at her.

“Alice, truth or dare?” Dan asked, picking up the pillow and handing it back to her.

“Thank you, and truth.” She smirked at Julie, who stuck her tongue out at her.

“It sounds like Julie’s bisexual,” he started, getting a big thumbs up from Julie. “What about you?”

“I mean, who isn’t at least a bit bi?” Alice shrugged and took a big drink. “Truth or dare?”

“Truth,” Dan answered.

“What’s your manscaping situation?”

Dan raised an eyebrow as Alice tried to play it cool. “Short and tidy. Truth or dare?”

“Truth, please.”

“What’s your ladyscaping situation?”

“I just trim. Hair’s there for a reason, and I can’t be bothered to shave all the time.” Sensing Julie’s eagerness, she turned and with exaggerated formality said, “Julie, would you like a truth or a dare?”

“Truth!”

“I already know the answer, but I don’t want you to feel left out of the grooming discussion. Would you like to share with the class?”

“You know I take it all off, babe!” Julie blurted. “I keep offering to refer you to my waxer!” Turning to Dan, she explained, “she’s this great old Hungarian lady, fantastic technique. Truth or dare?”

“Truth.”

“Do you prefer smooth as silk,” she said, gesturing toward her lap, “or classic 70s bush?”

“I do not have a 70s bush!” Alice protested, swatting Julie’s hand away.

Dan looked nervous and held up both hands as if to ward off the choice. “You know, regardless of the landscaping, I’m just happy to get a tour of the garden. Julie, truth or dare?”

“Truth.”

“Do you like to masturbate?”

“Alright, Dan!” Julie laughed, “now you’re getting into the spirit of the game! Yeah, I go through my share of batteries. Truth or dare?”

“Truth,” Dan grinned.

“How often do you rub one out?”

“Daily, before I go to sleep. Alice, truth or dare?”

“Truth.”

“When did you last get off?”

Alice took a slow sip of her beer, hesitating before answering. “In the shower this morning. Julie, truth or dare?”

“Truth,” Julie beamed. She felt this was going extremely well.

“What do you think about when you masturbate?”

“Two guys at once!” She answered with no hesitation, and Alice nearly choked. Dan looked impressed. “Sometimes it’s dudes I saw at the gym. Sometimes it’s old crushes. But they always make me a Julie sandwich.” She waggled her eyebrows at Dan as he and Alice both laughed. “Alice, truth or dare.”

“Truth.”

“Have you ever thought of Dan while masturbating?”

Alice blushed and avoided looking at Dan. “Um, on second thought, can I have a dare?”

“Fine, then. Take off your bra.”

Alice set down her beer, deftly unhooked her bra, and slipped it out her sleeve. She handed it to Julie, who nodded approvingly at the black mesh fabric and threw it to Dan. He jokingly held it up to his chest like he was trying it on.

Alice giggled and asked, “Dan, truth or dare?” She made no effort to cover her nipples pushing through the thin fabric of her shirt.

“Truth,” Dan answered, draping her bra over the back of the loveseat and doing his best not to stare.

“Have _you_ ever thought about _me_ while masturbating?”

Dan grinned, and let the question hang in the air before simply replying: “Dare.”

“Take off your shirt.”

He did, leaving Julie nodding approvingly at his rather nice chest. She was starting to get what Alice saw in this guy. Meeting her gaze, he asked, “truth or dare?”

“Truth.”

“Have you ever had a threesome?”

“Once.” Julie glanced meaningfully towards Alice in a way that Dan couldn’t miss. “Not with two guys yet, but I’m working on it. Truth or dare?”

“Truth”

“What about you? Ever had a threesome?”

“It’s… on my list.”

Julie winked at Alice, who took a sip of beer and pretended not to notice.

“Alice,” Dan asked, “truth or dare?”

“Truth.”

“What’s your favorite position?”

“I like to be on top,” she replied confidently. “Truth or dare?”

“Truth.”

“Are you one of those guys who won’t go down on a woman?”

“No, I’ve been told I’m quite good at it.” Alice tried to hide her smile as Dan turned to Julie. “Truth or dare?”

“Truth.”

“Are you a screamer?”

“Uh, yeah,” Julie grinned. “I’ve been known to get a bit vocal.”

“That’s an understatement,” Alice laughed. “I can clearly hear her through the wall whenever she brings someone home.”

Julie turned to Alice. “Truth or dare?”

“Truth.”

“Do you ever touch yourself when you hear me getting fucked?”

“Sometimes…” Alice blushed a deep red. “Truth or dare.”

“Truth.”

“Does it turn you on to know that I listen to you getting fucked?”

Julie smiled and took a drink, but did not answer.

“Fine, then, a dare for you. Take off your top.”

Dan watched eagerly as Julie peeled her top off, exposing her favorite bra. She winked at him. “Truth or dare, Dan.”

“Truth.”

“Are you circumcised?” She didn’t actually care, but the exchange with Alice had flustered her more than she cared to admit, and shifting the attention back to Dan seemed easier.

“Yeah, I am. Truth or dare?”

“Truth.”

“Did you and Alice really have a threesome?”

“Yeah.” Julie grinned at Alice, who grinned back. “And it was fucking hot.” She waited a long moment before saying, “Alice, truth or dare?”

“Truth.”

“Were you thinking about giving Dan head in the shower this morning?”

Alice blushed furiously and nearly choked on her beer. “Dare!”

“Fine, take off your pants.”

Alice stood up, unzipped her jeans, and shimmied them down her hips before kicking them off. A neatly trimmed triangle of pubic hair was visible through the black mesh of her thong. Dan tried not to gawk as Alice asked him, “truth or dare?”

“Truth.”

“Did you stick around after the party hoping to get lucky?”

He gave a sheepish grin. “Dare.”

“Okay, now take off _your_ pants.”

He let his jeans drop to the floor and sat back down, kicking them aside and trying to look casual while wearing only boxers. “Alice, truth or dare?”

“Truth?”

“Were you hoping I’d stick around to get lucky?”

Alice grinned, took a big drink, and said “Dare.”

“Show me your tits.”

Alice slowly lifted the hem of her shirt. Dan and Julie both stared. Alice had great breasts and knew it. After a few seconds, she covered up again, grinning and turning to Julie. “Truth or dare?”

“Truth.”

“Did you start this game so you could have another threesome with me?”

Julie took a long sip of beer and held her gaze for what felt like a very long time. “Dare.”

“Take off your skirt.”

She stood up, unzipped, and let the skirt slip down to the floor before kicking it out of the way. The blue cotton didn’t quite match her bra, but Dan’s hungry stare made it clear he didn’t care. She caught his eyes and asked, “truth or dare?”

“…Dare?”

“Go kiss Alice.” As he stood up, she clarified: “A _real_ kiss, not a peck on the cheek!”

He sauntered closer and bent down to give Alice a slow, gentle kiss. His hands cupped her face, and she leaned into him. Even so, the kiss seemed to end just a bit too quickly, as if he was afraid of overstaying his welcome.

He returned to the loveseat before asking Julie, “truth or dare?”

“Truth.”

“I’d also like to know if you started this game so you could have another threesome with Alice.”

Julie looked away and made a point of finishing her beer before answering. “You know, I think we’re done with truths for now. Let’s just play dares.”

“Fine,” Dan grinned, “now _you_ give Alice a _real_ kiss.”

Julie turned to Alice, who was smiling in anticipation. She climbed into Alice’s lap and kissed her deeply. Her fingers traced up Alice’s neck and into her hair. Their lips parted, and their tongues danced together. Alice whimpered and arched her back as Julie’s hands strayed lower, over Alice’s breasts, feeling her nipples stiffen under her palms. When she finally pulled away, Alice’s cheeks were flushed.

Julie gave her a minute before saying, “Alice, let Dan take off your shirt.”

Alice bit her lip, then smiled and nodded at Dan. He dropped to his knees in front of her, and she lifted her arms as he pulled her shirt up. As he did, he made a point to slowly slide his hands over her breasts, teasing her nipples. It seemed to take a very long time. Eventually, Dan sat back down, laying Alice’s shirt next to her bra on the back of the loveseat.

“Okay,” Alice murmured as she crossed her legs. Her nipples had contracted into hard buds. “Alright.” She let out a breath and took a long sip of her beer. After a moment, she turned to Julie and said, “Let Dan take off your bra.”

Grinning, Julie sat forward as Dan got to his knees in front of her. As he reached behind her, she leaned into him, brushing her lips against his stubble. He slowly unhooked the clasp and ran his fingers up and down her spine, making her shiver. She buried her face in the warmth of his neck as he slipped the straps from her shoulders. Finally, she leaned back, allowing him to pull her bra away from her chest. He stared hungrily at her dark nipples before returning to the loveseat, laying her bra next to Alice’s.

“Alice?” Julie purred, “go suck on Dan’s—” She paused, letting Dan’s anticipation build. “—fingers.”

Alice grinned and dropped to her knees in front of Dan. She lifted his hand to her lips. He watched, spellbound, as she began to kiss and lick his first two fingers. When she finally took them into her mouth, he inhaled sharply. Quickly, she began sucking with practiced ease. Julie felt a growing heat in her core as she watched Alice simulate a blowjob. When she finally moved back to the couch, Dan was clearly having difficulty slowing his breathing.

“Dan,” Alice began, speaking softly.

“Yes?” He tried not to sound flustered.

“Wanna hand over that pillow?”

Surprised, he glanced down and seemed to realize for the first time that he was holding a pillow in his lap as if he was afraid it would fly away. Laughing, he relaxed his grip. “Oh, uh, sure, here you go.” He gently tossed it to her and draped his arms across the back of the loveseat, a prominent erection tenting his boxers.

“You know,” he said, turning to Julie. “We both kissed Alice. It seems only fair that you should kiss me now.” As she got up to do so, Dan echoed her words: “But please, make sure this is a _real_ kiss, not a peck on the cheek!”

As Julie approached Dan, she leaned over him, planting her hands on the back of the loveseat to either side of his head. She wasn’t quite ready to climb into his lap, knowing that once she started grinding against him, it’d be hard to stop. Instead, she slowly and deliberately arched her back to drag her breasts down his face as she came in to kiss him.

Their lips parted immediately, and the steamy open-mouthed kiss that followed left her heart pounding. He kept his hands to himself, accepting what she offered but not pushing for more. She appreciated his restraint, but pulled his hand to her chest anyway. She shivered as he gently squeezed her nipple. With some reluctance, she broke away and returned to the couch.

“Alice?” She turned to her friend, who grinned excitedly. “Show Dan if you’re wet.”

Alice only briefly hesitated before reaching into her panties. Julie and Dan watched eagerly as her legs parted and her fingers moved below the mesh fabric. When she withdrew her hand, her index finger was glistening wet.

“Oh dear,” she teased Dan, “there seems to be some cream on my finger. Would you mind licking it off?”

In a heartbeat, Dan was on his knees with her finger in his mouth. He looked as though he was savoring the most delicious flavor in the world. Alice giggled and squirmed until he released her finger with a wet pop and returned to his seat.

Dan turned his attention eagerly to Julie. “Show me if _you’re_ wet?”

Julie grinned and simply spread her legs wide to reveal the dark wet spot on her panties. Dan stared hungrily at this evidence of her arousal until she crossed her legs again and turned to Alice. “Can I have your panties, please?”

Alice stood up and shimmied them off, but instead of handing them to Julie, she walked over to Dan. He watched with a grin on his face as she pulled open his waistband and reached in to wrap her thong around his erection.

Releasing his waistband with a snap, she straightened up and turned away. Clearly savoring their attention on her naked body, she swayed her hips as she walked back to the couch. She looked at Julie and said teasingly, “Why don’t you go get them?”

Julie laughed and went to stand over Dan. He watched with a big grin as she made a point of reaching into his boxers and rummaging around without looking. She played it up, as if unsure where to find Alice’s underwear. In reality, she firmly gripped his cock, rubbing the damp fabric against his swollen head. Finally, she made a surprised face as she “found” them and pulled them out with a flourish like a magician.

They gave her a polite round of applause, and she gave an exaggerated curtsey. Instead of returning to the couch, she sat down on the loveseat next to Dan. She leaned against him, draping her arm over his shoulder and winking conspiratorially at him. Then she looked at Alice and said, “why don’t you spread your legs and let Dan get a good look at you?”

Alice blushed, her cheeks matching the growing flush across her chest, but scooted lower on the couch and opened her thighs. Slowly, she reached down with two fingers and spread herself. At the sight of her pink inner lips, slick with her juices, Dan’s hand unconsciously drifted to his erection. Julie leaned closer and whispered in his ear, “do you see how wet she is for you?” He nodded, unable to look away as Alice started to trace a finger in lazy circles around her clit.

Perhaps inspired by Julie whispering in his ear, Alice said, “why don’t you climb in his lap and tell him about our last threesome?”

Eagerly, Julie moved to straddle him, with her hands on his shoulders. He gasped as she lowered herself against his erection. She rolled her hips, grinding her clit along his shaft. She could clearly feel the heat of his cock through the two thin layers of fabric that separated them. Finally, she leaned forward, pressing her chest against his, arms wrapped around his neck. His skin was hot, and she felt an answering heat inside her. She started whispering in his ear, knowing his eyes remained locked on Alice’s pussy.

“So Alice was on her hands and knees, and the guy was behind her, fucking her.” Julie felt his cock throb as she said that. “I was under her, with my head between her thighs. I had the best view of his cock thrusting in and out. She’d already made me cum from eating me out,” (throb) “but now she was distracted by his cock. Fuck, it was hot. I started licking her.” (throb) “Every time he pulled out, I would lick the length of his shaft.” (throb) “When he pushed deeper, I would circle her clit.” (throb) “It didn’t take long before she came. She gushed around his cock, into my mouth.”
Dan was breathing heavily, his hands caressing her thighs, but his eyes still fixed in Alice’s direction. Julie turned around to look and grinned when she saw her roommate still masturbating for Dan.

“Alice, telling this story is getting me so hot, will you suck on my nipple while I grind against Dan?”

Alice wasted no time moving to sit next to Dan and wrap her lips around Julie’s nipple. Julie gasped as she sucked more of her breast into the heat of her mouth. She continued rocking her hips, grinding against Dan’s throbbing shaft.

“Alice, I was telling Dan about how I was licking your clit while you got fucked.”

Alice purred happily, her tongue dancing around Julie’s nipple.

“I told him how hot it was to watch, to see you cum, and see his — ah! — see his cock swelling inside you.”

Dan was gripping her hips, biting his lip as Julie rubbed against him, and he watched Alice suck on her breast. He looked up at Julie eagerly, and she nodded, pulling his face to her other breast.

“Yeah, you can suck on my other — oh! — nipple. Oh fuck, yeah, keep doing that.”

Julie’s grinding was becoming more insistent. She had one hand wrapped around the back of each of their heads. Dan’s cock was unyielding against her, and her clit seemed to crackle with electricity as she dragged it along the length of his shaft. Their tongues swirled around her nipples as she struggled to keep talking.

“Alice, it was so fucking sexy to see your pussy lips wrapped around his cock. When he said he was about to cum — ooh! — I pulled him out of you and into my mouth — ah! — he was covered in your cream, and it tasted so good — fuck! — he was so ready and he thrust forward — uh! — into my throat and suddenly he was — aaaah! — cumming! Cumming!”

As if to punctuate the story, Julie’s first orgasm rolled down her spine. She tightened her grip on their hair, pulling them harder against her breasts. Her pussy was clenching, yearning to be filled. Every flick of a tongue against her nipples sent sparks flowing down to her clit.

It was too much. She cried out and pushed them both away, dropping her head onto Dan’s shoulder. He held her tight and she shuddered against him as her climax receded.

Dan’s cock throbbed against her, and he spoke softly. “Why don’t you and Alice trade places?”

Grinning, Julie allowed him to roll her to the side. Alice quickly took her place straddling Dan, hands on his shoulders. She leaned forward to rest her breast against Dan’s face, who eagerly opened his mouth around her nipple. Alice gasped and reached for Julie as he started sucking. Grinning, she leaned in and began tracing circles with her tongue around Alice’s areola. She felt her nipple stiffen and pulled it deeper into her mouth.

Alice started moaning as she rolled her hips repeatedly against Dan, rubbing the head of his cock against her opening. He was gripping her hips tightly, pulling her against him. She followed his lead, leaning forward, gasping at the constant stimulation. They all rocked back and forth repeatedly, Alice’s arousal growing.

Dan grunted and reached back to grab her ass, his fingers digging hard into her flesh. Alice squeaked and leaped from his lap. She stood squirming in front of them, wetness running down her thighs, trying to catch her breath.

“Oh! Oh, sorry. That was a little too much too fast… I… I need a minute.”

Dan groaned with a mixture of desire and frustration, but nodded. “Uh, yeah, that’s probably a good idea, I don’t know how much more of that I could take.” Julie grinned as she noticed the front of his boxers were absolutely soaked with Alice’s creamy juices.
Alice noticed where she was looking and giggled. “I’m sorry, but I seem to have made a mess of your underwear.” She bit her lip, clearly not sorry at all. “Why don’t you take them off?”

Grinning, Dan got to his feet, and peeled his boxers off, letting them drop to the floor and kicking them aside. Julie nodded appreciatively as he revealed a pleasant cock with well-groomed pubes. It bobbed proudly erect, jutting towards Julie as if asking for her attention.

Dan saw her looking and smiled. “Now it’s your turn.”

She climbed to her feet to stand with the two of them, slipped her underwear down her hips, and stepped out of them.

They all stood naked in the middle of the room. Alice slipped an arm around Julie’s waist. Julie allowed herself to be pulled into a slow, soft kiss. Aware of his gaze, she reached out for Dan and pulled him in. She broke off the kiss with Alice and angled up to kiss him. Alice nuzzled her ear and cupped her ass until Julie led Dan to kiss Alice again. Back and forth they went, kissing and caressing each other’s bodies.

Finally, as Alice and Dan were kissing, Julie reached down and started rubbing his cock. He gasped but kept kissing Alice, even as his cock twitched in her hand. Julie brushed her lips against Alice’s ear and said, “I want to watch you go down on Dan.”

Dan allowed Julie to lead him to the couch, where she gently pushed him down and sat next to him, still stroking his cock. They watched eagerly as Alice got to her knees between his legs. Alice deftly slipped her hand beneath Julie’s and took over stroking, so Julie laid back to watch.

As Alice took him into her mouth, Dan groaned and dropped his head back. He ran his hands through her hair and mumbled her name.

Julie bit her lip and watched happily, lazily rubbing herself. Watching Alice give head was really hot. Dan’s stomach tensed as her head bobbed up and down. Julie imagined Alice’s tongue swirling, teasing the tip.

“Oh my god, Alice, that feels good,” Dan moaned. In response, Alice pushed forward, swallowing his cock deeper. Julie moaned at the sight and slipped a finger between her slick pussy lips. Alice relaxed and moved back, releasing his cock from her mouth, but continuing to stroke him as she gasped for breath.

“You have a really nice cock, Dan,” she murmured before wrapping her lips around his head once again. Dan groaned and put a hand on top of her head, not pushing, but encouraging. Julie’s hand moved more urgently, palm rubbing against her clit as her finger slipped in and out, matching the pace that Alice sucked his cock.

Dan noticed Julie masturbating, and watched eagerly. Julie grinned and added another finger. Dan was now lifting his hips, trying to push deeper into Alice’s mouth, who was moaning with each thrust. Sensing the need to slow things down before he came, Julie pulled her fingers from her pussy and pushed them abruptly into Dan’s mouth.

He grunted in surprise, but it worked. He relaxed and stopped thrusting, focused on sucking the cream from Julie’s fingers. She leaned in and murmured in his ear, “easy there, Dan, let’s make it last.” She pulled her fingers from his mouth and gave him a soft kiss.

Alice released his cock with a wet sound and stood up, licking her lips. “Julie, will you go get a condom while Dan goes down on me?”

Julie grinned and stood up, wrapping both arms around Alice and kissing her deeply. Alice seemed surprised, but melted into the embrace and kissed her back. Julie pulled back, winked at her, and happily skipped off toward the restroom.

As she got the box of condoms out of the cabinet (almost out, she noted), she heard Alice moan in the living room. Eagerly, she jogged back in to see that Alice and Dan had traded places. Alice sprawled lewdly on the couch, slouched low with her ass hanging off the edge and her legs spread wide. Dan was kneeling before her, with his face buried between her thighs, like he was worshipping her. Alice was already breathing heavily and squeezing her breasts. Apparently, Dan wasn’t lying when he said he was good at oral.

Alice opened her eyes and grinned at Julie, still gasping with pleasure. Julie held up the condom and gave her a thumbs-up. In response, Alice’s eyes rolled up in her head and she swore loudly as Dan did something with his tongue.

Julie grinned and dropped to her knees behind Dan. Quickly tearing the wrapper, she pulled out the condom, figured out which way it unrolled, and pinched it by the tip. He jumped in surprise when she reached her arms around and grabbed his cock, but Alice grabbed his head and ground his face back against her vulva.

Quickly, Julie rolled the condom down the length of his shaft. Once it was in place, she moved around to one side so she could watch. Dan was working his face side to side, his tongue tracing broad circles over Alice’s lips. He would lick upward in a circle around her clit before wrapping his lips around it and sucking. Then, just before it would be too much, he licked downward, pushing between her lips as deep as he could reach, before licking back upward again. Alice’s stomach was tense, her chest flushed, erect nipples peeking between her fingers.

Julie leaned in and murmured in his ear, “I think she’s ready for you now.” She pulled him back upright and kissed him. Alice’s juices coated his face, which Julie didn’t mind at all. She pushed her tongue deep into his mouth, savoring the taste, before breaking off and pushing him gently backward. “Lie down here on the rug.”

Dan obediently lay on his back as Julie helped Alice get to her feet, and walked her over to stand over him. Alice got to her knees and positioned his cock between her lips. They all grinned at each other, savoring the anticipation, until Alice lowered herself, gasping as she took his full length.

Alice and Dan both seemed to be holding their breath, adjusting to the sensation. She rolled her hips and arched her back, letting out a long, low groan. Dan reached up to cup her breasts, and she squeezed his hands as she started rocking on top of him.

Julie found herself kneeling by Dan’s shoulder, rubbing her clit as she watched the two of them fuck. She stared hungrily at the sight of Dan’s cock disappearing between Alice’s lips, which seemed to be devouring him whole. Dan groaned as she moved above him, and squeezed her nipples hard, until she cried out, moving her hips faster.

Dan looked up and saw Julie rubbing herself. “Let me taste you,” he gasped.

Julie didn’t hesitate, swinging her leg over to straddle his face. She felt him raise his head behind her, eager to make contact, and lowered herself until she felt his lips against hers. His tongue slipped between her folds, probing deep inside. She gasped and fell forward with her hands on his torso, pressing her clit against his tongue. Following her lead, he began flicking against her sensitive bud, until she was panting.

She felt a hand on her face and looked up to see Alice watching her, eyes full of desire. Without needing to speak, the girls fell towards each other and began kissing. It was awkward with all three of them moving and rocking, but they were too aroused to care. Alice moaned into Julie’s mouth, and their hands roamed over each other’s bodies. Fingers tangled in hair, squeezing breasts, caressing hips. Gasping as Dan’s tongue lashed her clit, Julie broke the kiss and dropped her face to Alice’s chest. Alice moaned and guided Julie’s mouth to her nipple.

Alice was grunting and moaning and bouncing faster, grinding Dan’s cock deeper into her, mashing her breast against Julie’s face. She had one hand tangled in Julie’s hair and the other was frantically rubbing her clit. Her breathing came faster and faster until suddenly she cried out and her body stiffened. Julie released her nipple and pulled Alice’s head to her shoulder. For several long moments, Alice shook and moaned into Julie’s neck as the orgasm pulsated through her body. Finally, she climbed to her feet and dropped onto the couch, one hand clamped between her thighs, trying to catch her breath.

Julie found herself leaning forward, still grinding her clit against Dan’s mouth. His cock was jutting towards her, slick with Alice’s cream as he thrust upward, desperate for more contact. Julie lowered herself and took his cock in her mouth. The condom tasted rubbery and medicinal, but Alice’s cum was delicious. Dan’s cock throbbed in her mouth, swelling as he tried to push deeper. Julie tried to swallow him and gagged, forced to back off as Dan moaned between her thighs.

Gasping for breath, she sat up and lifted herself off his face. He looked up at her, face covered in her wetness, panting and eager. “Get behind me, Dan.” He was only too happy to oblige.

Dan moved behind her as she dropped to her hands and knees. She bit her lip in anticipation as she felt him rub his cock against her, working it between her lips. A guttural moan escaped her lips when he pushed forward, burying himself to the hilt in one thrust. Her pussy responded to being filled by clenching uncontrollably around his girth. It felt delicious.

He started moving, gripping her hips and thrusting forward. Each backstroke took him nearly all the way out of her, then he would pull her back, hard, fucking her against him as he pushed deeper.

“Fuck your cock feels good in me,” she groaned, eyes rolling. She looked up and saw Alice on the couch, watching her with lust in her eyes. Meeting her hooded gaze, Alice spread her legs again, letting Julie see the two fingers she had buried in her pussy.

“Get in front of Julie,” Dan gasped from behind her. “I want to watch you touch yourself while I fuck her.” He was practically moaning as he said it, and Julie suspected he wasn’t used to asking for what he wanted so bluntly.

Alice moved down to the floor, laying on her back with her legs spread, rubbing her clit eagerly in front of Julie’s face. Before long, she was gasping and moaning, still holding eye contact with Julie. With every thrust, Julie came closer to Alice’s pussy. The stimulating smell of Alice’s arousal filled her head. She knew Dan was trying to push her closer. She didn’t mind, she wanted the same thing.

“Oh my god, Julie!” Alice suddenly blurted, “I’m so close, I need your fingers, please, please put your fingers in me.” Dan moaned appreciatively behind her as Julie shifted her weight to her left elbow. She slipped two fingers into Alice’s sopping pussy and felt her insides immediately clench around her, pulsing in time with Alice’s moans. A hot gush of fluid washed over her fingers as Alice slapped the floor and cried out in wordless pleasure.

Julie felt her own orgasm building and pushed back against Dan. “Fuck me harder, I’m close!” Dan’s pace quickened, clearly as aroused as she was by the sight of Alice’s orgasm. Julie rested her forehead against the rug, eyes screwed shut, focused on the sensation of the cock slamming ever deeper inside. She reached down to rub her clit. She was getting closer, but needed something more.

“Slap my ass!” She barked, surprising even herself. Dan obliged, a single sharp stinging slap across her ass cheek. She gasped, and moaned, “again!” Another slap on the other cheek, the tingling mixing with the overwhelming sensations from her pussy. Dan gripped her hips even harder, thrusting roughly into her as she panted.

“Oh my god, that feels so good,” Dan groaned. “I can feel your cunt squeezing me.” He gasped as he said the word cunt, and so did she. “I’m gonna cum soon…”

“Fuuuuuuck yes, yes, yes, do it,” Julie begged, feeling her body tensing, her climax approaching. “Cum for me, I want you to cum!”

Dan cried out loudly and squeezed her hips so hard it hurt, pulling her tightly against him to reach as deep as possible. She gasped as she felt his cock throbbing inside her, pumping his cum into the condom. Her orgasm was hovering right on the edge, she just needed a little more. Abruptly he pulled out, and she collapsed to the floor, rolling onto her back, and cursing in frustration, she was so close.

Alice dove between her legs. Julie cried out in surprise as she felt her hot tongue moving in tight circles around her clit. She felt fingers enter her, hooking upward. Almost immediately, she felt the wave of her orgasm crash hard. She grabbed a fistful of Alice’s hair and pulled her closer, grinding her clit against her tongue. She heard Alice moan in surprise as she came again, pleasure rolling down her spine, through her pelvis, and into Alice’s mouth. Alice stayed with her, steady, firm pressure until Julie relaxed. Only then did she pull away, making Julie shiver as she withdrew her fingers.

They all lay collapsed in a heap on the rug, breathing heavily and laughing.

Julie climbed into Alice’s bed to cuddle. Dan had made a polite and only slightly awkward exit a while ago. Alice was sleepily playing a game on her phone. She stirred as she felt the covers lift, and wrapped an arm around Julie as she curled up against her side, one leg thrown over hers.

“Honestly,” Alice said, with a smile, “I don’t know why we pay for a two-bedroom apartment. We basically only use one bed.”

“Mmmm,” Julie agreed drowsily. “…don’t like sleeping alone.”

“Lucky for me,” Alice said and kissed her forehead before returning to her game.

Julie was already asleep.
