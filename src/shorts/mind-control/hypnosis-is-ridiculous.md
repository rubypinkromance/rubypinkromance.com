“Hey, Lauren.” Brad grinned at her from across the snack table. “Did I ever tell you I know hypnosis?” He was prone to outrageous claims like this. Once, he’d spent weeks trying to convince her that he was descended from royalty.

“I think I’d remember if you ever said something like that.” she winked playfully, pouring herself more eggnog. “See, I would have lost all respect for you, since hypnosis is bullshit.”

Lauren had been hiding in the break room, avoiding two groups of coworkers at the office holiday party. Karen was trying to gather people for a Christmas-themed trivia game, and Joey was drunkenly recruiting people to go caroling, of all things.

Brad didn’t know it, but his timing was perfect. He might be a bit of a dork, but bantering with him was far more entertaining than trivia.

“Hey, come on,” he protested, laughing off her good-natured ribbing. “I’m serious. I took a course and everything. Even got a certificate!”

“A certificate! Well, that changes everything. How much did that cost you?”

“Well,” he hesitated, picking up a cookie, “you can’t really put a price on a life-changing ability like this.”

“Ooh, it was a _lot_, huh?” She sucked air between her teeth, playing it up. “That’s too bad, buddy.”

They paused for a moment as a few coworkers came in to grab drinks. One of them warned Lauren that Karen was looking for her.

“I’m telling you,” Brad said confidently after the others left, “this is the real deal.”

“And I’m telling you, you got scammed.” She grinned and sipped her eggnog.

“Lauren,” he said with sudden seriousness. “I’ll bet you a hundred bucks I can hypnotize you.”

She eyed him over the rim of her cup. He wasn’t kidding! She’d thought he was just goofing around, but maybe he really did get scammed? Now she actually felt a little bad for him.

On the other hand, a hundred bucks…

“Come on,” he said, seeing her consider it. “What do you have to lose? You think hypnosis is bullshit, right? It should be easy money.”

“I dunno. How does this work? Are you gonna try to hypnotize me here in the break room? Make me think I’m a chicken or something?”

“No, no, all this Christmas music is too distracting. We should go somewhere quieter. And don’t worry about the chicken thing, hypnosis can’t make you do anything you don’t want to do.”

The approaching sound of drunken singing made up her mind.

“Alright, quick, before Joey finds us. Let’s go to an empty office so I can win this bet, and you can contribute to my shoe fund.”

A few minutes later, having successfully evaded the carolers, Lauren shut the door behind her. The office had a nice view of the city, and a miniature Christmas tree with twinkling lights on the windowsill. Brad pulled out the desk chair for her.

She sat down carefully, adjusting the hem of her dress, and tried not to smirk as Brad got into character. He rolled up his sleeves and produced a shiny copper coin hung from a chain. Standing seriously before her, he set the coin swinging like a pendulum. She played along, following it with her eyes.

“Now, I want you to focus on the coin. Watch it swing back and forth.” He spoke in a low voice, clearly reciting a memorized script. “Back and forth. You are becoming relaxed. Back and forth.”

She didn’t feel any different. Maybe a little warm. A bit distracted by a raucous group of people coming down the hall. Something crashed, and they all laughed loudly. “Don’t worry about that noise,” he improvised. “Just focus on the coin.”

Lauren tried not to laugh. This was going to be the easiest money she’d ever made. She wondered how long he’d keep trying before admitting defeat.

“Whew, it’s warm in here,” he murmured, undoing a button on his shirt with one hand while continuing to swing the coin with the other. “Back and forth. You should be feeling very relaxed now.”

She shifted uncomfortably in the chair. He was right, this office was quite warm. She slipped her cardigan off, hanging it over the back of the chair, trying to keep her eyes on the coin.

“Your focus is entirely on the coin. Back and forth. Relaxed. Calm.” He wiped his forehead nervously. “No thoughts, no concerns, no hesitations, just, um,” he trailed off as he fumbled with another shirt button. “Sorry, can you help me out? This is tricky with one hand.”

Rolling her eyes, she reached up to finish unbuttoning his shirt. He continued to swing the coin in front of her face. Did he really think this was working? She helped him pull his arm from one sleeve, then he moved the coin to his other hand, and let her pull the other sleeve off. Carelessly, he tossed his shirt onto the desk, standing before her in an undershirt. Without stopping the coin’s movement, he fanned himself with his other hand.

“Back and forth. Your relaxation is growing with every passing moment. Back and forth.”

She felt a trickle of sweat roll down her back and bit her lip in annoyance. Despite his continued intonation, she did not feel relaxed. She crossed, then uncrossed her legs. If he took much longer, she was going to sweat through her dress.

“I’m sorry, it’s so warm in here!” He grinned sheepishly. “It doesn’t, um, normally take this long. I’m sure the heat is making it hard to concentrate. Just try to focus on the coin.”

This was ridiculous. She wondered if he’d picked this office on purpose, to trick her into giving up and losing the bet. That wasn’t going to happen. He’d never let her hear the end of it. She had to stick it out. But if he took much longer, she was going to end up sweaty and disheveled.

“Hold on,” she said. “I can’t concentrate like this.”

“Oh? Are you ready to give up and admit I know hypnosis?” He asked eagerly.

“Not even,” she laughed as she stood up and turned partly away from him, trying to watch the coin over her shoulder. “Unzip me?” Sensing his hesitation, she rolled her eyes. “Don’t get any funny ideas. It’s just that if you take any longer, I’m going to sweat through everything, and this outfit is dry-clean only.”

Slowly, he unzipped her dress, which she slipped off with great relief. After laying it carefully over the back of the chair, she sat down again, wearing just her bra and thong. It was still too warm, but now she could focus on winning the bet.

Brad was staring. She crossed her arms and gave him a pointed look. He cleared his throat and tore his eyes from her chest, still swinging the coin.

“Sorry! Sorry. Um, back and forth. Back and forth.”

He seemed so flustered, she almost felt bad. She resolved to play along and help him get his confidence back, so that later, he wouldn’t accuse her of distracting him.

“You are feeling very relaxed. Very calm. You are not bothered at all by how stupidly hot it is in this office.” He untucked his undershirt, and quickly flapped the hem, trying to fan himself.

She sighed and tried to keep her focus on the coin. It was like a sauna in here. She glanced at the window and briefly considered leaning against the cool glass for relief.

“Back and forth…” He hesitated, wiping his forehead again. “Okay, I wouldn’t ask this, except you took your dress off, so, um, would it be okay if I did the same?”

“Seems only fair,” she conceded. “I suppose you need help again?”

“If that’s okay,” he said, kicking his shoes off. “If I stop swinging the coin, we’ll have to start over again.”

She stood up to help pull his undershirt over his head, one arm at a time. He had a nice chest, she noted idly, resisting a sudden urge to run her hands over his torso. She blinked the thought away. Where did that come from?

He kept swinging the coin in front of her face as she sat down. Leaning forward, she unbuckled his belt and started lowering his slacks.

“Dude!” She jerked back at the unexpected sight of his cock swinging free.

“Shit!” He awkwardly attempted to tug his slacks back up with one hand. “Sorry! I forgot I came to the party commando.” He hesitated. “But, do I really have to put my pants back on? I mean, you’ve already seen it. And, seriously, it’s _so_ hot in here.”

He continued swinging the coin as she frowned at him. Some part of her knew she should be upset. But he looked so awkward, she couldn’t bring herself to be mad. Plus, she had to admit he wasn’t bad to look at. Surprisingly hung. He kept trimmed and looked clean. It twitched hopefully as she regarded it.

“Whatever, forget about it,” she said, swatting his hand away, and letting his slacks fall to the floor. “It’s just a penis. Nothing to worry about.”

“Cool.” He stood confidently before her, swinging the coin. “Then, keep focusing. Back and forth. You are deeply relaxed.”

Hypnosis was bullshit, but she had to admit, he’d finally managed to capture her full attention. She bit her lip. His cock was slowly swelling to life, lifting toward her, and swaying in time with the coin.

“Back and forth. God, it’s so hot in here,” he exclaimed again. “Are you sure you’re not too warm? I mean, now that I’m undressed, I feel way better. Wouldn’t you be more comfortable if you took your bra and underwear off? It seems silly for me to be naked, while you have to keep those on.”

She was feeling flushed. Her bra itched, and she struggled to think of a reason to keep it on. He was already naked. She was nearly naked. And nothing inappropriate was going to happen, it was just practical to strip down in this heat.

“Fine,” she sighed. “I guess if you’ve already gone that far, there’s no reason for me to be uncomfortable.” She unhooked her bra and let it slip down her arms, feeling immediate relief. The air felt good on her bare skin. She exhaled in satisfaction and lay it on top of her dress.

“There you go,” he grinned as she stood up and pulled down her thong. “Feels better, huh? Now you can focus. That money is as good as yours.”

“That’s right!” She laughed and gave him a wink. “I told you hypnosis is bullshit. I don’t feel any different at all.”

She didn’t feel hypnotized, but she was struggling to focus on the coin instead of his cock. It was now fully erect, and bobbed back and forth in time with the coin. She wondered how it would feel in her hand. To her surprise, she found herself starting to reach for him, and quickly grabbed the edge of the seat instead.

“Are you sure about that?” He raised an eyebrow.

“Absolutely sure. I’m wide awake and in full control.” She resolved not to let him see how distracted she was. He’d try to claim it was the hypnosis, but it was only natural to want to look. How often did you get to see a coworker nude, let alone with their rather appealing erection swaying in front of your face? No one could blame her for being curious.

“Back and forth. You’re becoming entranced.” His voice dropped back into that practiced rhythm. “Back and forth.”

She squeezed her legs together and tried to focus on the bet. If she proved him wrong, she’d get a hundred bucks to put towards those new shoes she wanted. All she had to do was concentrate, and stop getting distracted by the thought of running her tongue up his shaft like a popsicle.

“Follow the movement. Back and forth. You feel deeply relaxed.”

Fuck, what was she doing? This was inappropriate! She shouldn’t be salivating over Brad’s dick like this. No matter how enticing it looked, or how good it would feel to touch…

“You’re getting very aroused.”

“What?” She looked up at him, blushing furiously. “How did you… I mean, no I’m not!”

“You haven’t been watching the coin at all.”

“Well, I, just,” she gestured at his cock. “It’s distracting!”

“I can see that. Your nipples are hard.”

“That doesn’t mean anything!” She protested, resisting the suddenly overwhelming urge to squeeze her breasts.

“And you’re squirming.”

“I am?” Shit. She hadn’t realized quite how obvious she was being. Now that she considered it, that familiar heat between her thighs had been building for some time.

“It’s okay,” Brad reassured her. “Obviously, I’m turned on, too. I’ve been trying not to take advantage of your hypnotized state, but, uh, it’s difficult when you lick your lips and lean closer like that.”

She hadn’t realized how far forward she was bending. With some effort, she forced herself to lean back in the chair.

“Look, forget about the coin,” he said, dropping it on the floor. “Hypnosis works with any focal point. And you’ve been fixated on my cock ever since we got undressed.”

“What? No, dude. I didn’t get hypnotized by your dick. Don’t be ridiculous.”

“Hey, it’s perfectly natural! You wanted to win the bet so bad, you slipped into a state of hyper-focus.” His cock twitched. “And now you can’t stop staring.”

“I can stop!” She wrenched her eyes away, and triumphantly stuck her tongue out at him. “See? Just admit that you never hypnotized me.”

“I can’t do that. You’re definitely in a trance. Look at you, with your tongue out, leaning forward again without realizing it. It’s obvious that you’re thinking about wrapping your lips around me.”

“I’m not!” She absolutely was. She wanted to lick up that little bead of precum that had appeared at the tip. To swirl her tongue around his head, and swallow him. With some difficulty, she closed her mouth and pulled away.

“Do you even realize you’ve got a hand between your legs? Do you know how long you’ve been playing with yourself?”

“I didn’t,” she protested, “I wasn’t…” But it was true. Without even realizing she was doing it, her fingers had begun caressing her lips. She was sensitive, hungry for stimulation, and slick with excitement.

“Are you wet?”

“No! I mean, fuck, yes,” she swore as she slipped a finger inside, “but this is stupid. Hypnosis is bullshit. I’m probably just ovulating, is all. I always get horny this time of the month, and you were swinging your cock in front of my face. Of course I got turned on! If we hadn’t picked such a warm office, and started undressing, nothing would have happened.”

“I have to tell you,” he said with some reluctance, “it’s not actually very warm in here. That was part of the hypnosis. I didn’t expect it to go this far.”

“That’s ridiculous. It’s like a sauna in here. The thermostat must be broken.”

“Lauren, I’m sorry that I’m such a gifted hypnotist.” He wrapped his hand around his shaft and started stroking. “I’m trying to do the right thing, but it’s hard with you touching yourself like that.”

“Gifted, my ass,” she groaned, squeezing her breast. “You got swindled with a fake hypnosis class, and spent thirty minutes waving that stupid coin in front of me.” Unable to stop herself, she added another finger, curling inward.

“How can you be so sure?” He gasped, flicking his thumb over his head. “Look at you spreading your legs so I can see you fingering yourself. You can’t help it. You got hypnotized by my cock, and now you’re uncontrollably aroused.”

“Nooo,” she protested, “I’m not! I just—Fuck, I’m so wet—It’s not hypnosis, it’s just dumb luck. Right place, right time. If it wasn’t you, I’d have gone home early, and I’d be rubbing one out in bed right now.”

“I don’t believe you,” he panted, stepping closer, masturbating directly in front of her face.

“I don’t care,” she moaned. “I just… Oh fuck, I just need…”

“If you’re not hypnotized,” he shivered, feeling her hot breath on his skin, “then why are you opening your mouth for me?”

“Oh, shut up.” Her fingers worked urgently, wetness dripping from her knuckles. With her mouth open wide, she leaned forward, unable to stop herself.

He groaned as she wrapped her lips around him as last. He was hot and firm, and she moaned as his cock throbbed on her tongue. The pressure in her core was building, squeezing around her fingers. He leaned forward, bracing himself on the back of the chair.

“Lauren,” he gasped in surprise as she angled her head to let him go deeper. “Oh fuck!” She braced her hand on his pelvis as he pushed eagerly into her throat. She struggled to relax her jaw, resisting the instinct to gag. “Fuck!” He thrust forward, unable to resist the urge to bury himself. She saw flares of color at the edge of her vision, and a warm gush around her fingers.

Finally, she pushed him away, choking as he pulled out. He staggered back against the wall, hand in a fist around the base of his cock. She sank back in the chair, gasping for breath. He stared, eyes wide, as she rubbed tight circles around her clit with one hand, still fingering herself with the other. She watched hungrily as he started slowly stroking the length of his shaft for her.

“I know that, uh,” he panted, struggling to control himself. “I know you want to win the bet. I know you think hypnosis is fake.” She shook her head, wanting him to stop talking. “But, come on. Just admit it! Admit that you’re absurdly turned on, and it’s because you were put in a trance by my cock.”

“Fuck me,” she groaned. “I’ve never seen a dude work so hard to avoid getting laid.”

“Laid?” His cock throbbed eagerly in his hand. “Lauren, look, I like you, and fucking hell do I want to go further, but you’re in a trance. It wouldn’t be right.”

“I’m not in a goddamn trance,” she growled. “I’m just horny, and I need a cock inside me, and you’re lucky enough to be here.”

“I don’t know,” he hesitated. “I don’t want to risk our friendship.”

“What’s risking our friendship is if you don’t bend me over this desk right now.”

Before he could answer, she got out of the chair and shoved everything on the desk to one side. Then she bent over the edge, and wiggled her ass at him.

“Oh fuck,” he mumbled, stepping up behind her. She shivered in anticipation as he rubbed the head of his cock between her lips. “Alright.” She laid her cheek on the cool surface and grabbed the far side of the desktop. They both moaned as he pushed inside, burying himself in one stroke.

She felt deliriously good as he filled her. It was like letting out a breath she hadn’t realized she’d been holding. The entire time she’d been watching his cock sway back and forth in front of her eyes, her body had been preparing for this moment.

He grabbed her hips as he started sliding in and out. Every motion sent a ripple of sensation along her spine, leaving her gasping in time with his thrusts. He groaned as she squeezed around him, desperate for more. Her body was crackling with lust. She couldn’t believe how good this felt.

Abandoning any efforts at control, he began moving more urgently. She bit her knuckle to keep from loudly crying out with every thrust. The smaller items on the desk moved rhythmically, inching closer and closer to the edge. A cup of pens clattered loudly to the floor. A desk lamp fell, hanging by the cord, swaying in time.

His cock seemed to swell, and she suddenly needed to shove a hand between her legs, clamping her fingers over her clit. Firm pressure helped to diffuse the nearly overwhelming sensation. She moaned, and reached lower, to brush against his shaft thrusting urgently into her. He was hard and hot and slick with her wetness.

He groaned, feeling her touch, and started fucking her even harder. His fingers dug painfully into her hips, and she did cry out then. Her body shook, spasming with pleasure, squeezing around his girth. With a gush, she came, dripping down her thighs and onto the floor.

“Lauren,” he panted, “I’m close. Where should I cum?”

Her cunt clenched excitedly at the thought of letting him finish inside. She moaned happily, knowing that her climax was pushing him closer to the edge. Still holding her clit with one hand, she lifted onto her other elbow to look back at him.

“Cum inside me,” she moaned.

“Oh fuck,” he gasped, eyes wide with surprise. “Are you sure—ah!—you don’t want me to cum on your tits?”

“Stop trying to prove you hypnotized me! I know what I want!” She rubbed her clit, building rapidly towards another orgasm. “Now, pull my hair and fucking cum in me!”

He reached forward, grabbed her hair in one hand, and pulled gently back, grunting with each thrust.

“Harder!” She groaned.

He tightened his grip, jerking her head back. Her mouth hung open, panting as he fucked her over the desk. Waves of pleasure radiated from her core, rippling around his cock.

“Cumming!” He blurted, as he slammed into her one last time, burying himself deep.

“Fuck! Yes!” She shuddered as she felt him twitching. “Oh my god!”

He let go of her hair and leaned against her, making a little surprised sound each time he throbbed inside her.

She moaned happily, finally feeling completely relaxed.

After some time, he softened and slipped out. She covered her lips with her fingers, trying to keep his cum from leaking all over the floor. The pressure felt good.

He stumbled back and collapsed into the desk chair, trying to catch his breath.

She turned around, leaning on the desk with one hand between her legs, and smiled crookedly at him.

“Fucking hell, Brad, that was something.”

He laughed breathlessly and gave her a thumbs-up in agreement.

Still tingling with aftershocks of pleasure, she picked up a fallen box of tissues and started wiping up.

“Lauren,” he said, climbing to his feet, “that was incredible.” She nodded in agreement. “But seriously, I shouldn’t have let that get out of hand…”

“Are you still worried about the bet?” She laughed incredulously. “You lost, man! Your hypnosis didn’t do anything, just like I knew it wouldn’t.”

“No, seriously, I don’t think you…”

“Brad, forget it.” She stepped into her underwear. “Did you have a good time?”

“Well, yeah, but…” He watched her fasten her bra with concern in his eyes.

“So did I. I’ll make you a deal.” She pulled up her dress and turned around so he could zip her up. “Keep your money, but take me out to dinner soon.”

He nodded as she gave him a kiss on the cheek.

“And no more hypnosis talk, alright? It was a decent pickup line, but you can consider me ‘captivated’ already.”

She walked out feeling quite pleased with herself, leaving him looking awestruck.

Hypnosis! Ridiculous.
