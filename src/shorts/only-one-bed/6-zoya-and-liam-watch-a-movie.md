Zoya stretched languidly and listened to the sound of pouring rain. The bed was warm, and she was in no hurry to get up. She could hear Nolan in the shower, and pictured him soaping up to wash away his and Emma’s cum. It had been hard not to make any noise as she masturbated to them going down on each other. Even after cumming twice, her dreams had been a swirl of intensely erotic scenarios.

Glancing over the edge of the bed, she saw Liam sleeping on his back, one leg sticking out from under his sheet. He clearly had morning wood. She bit her lip and considered waking him up with a surprise blowjob, but then the shower turned off. Nolan would walk out in a minute, and Liam didn’t strike her as the kind of guy who appreciated an audience. Too bad.

She rolled over toward Emma, who was facing away from her. The redhead stirred as Zoya spooned her, cupping her breast. She grinned when she felt Emma’s nipple stiffen through the satin fabric.

“Good morning, Em,” she whispered.

“Mornin’, Zee,” Emma mumbled, gently brushing Zoya’s hand away and sitting up.

“G’day!” Nolan exclaimed cheerfully as he emerged from the bathroom wearing shorts and a t-shirt, still rubbing his hair dry with a towel. “Shame about the rain. What should we do today?”

“Maybe a movie?” Zoya suggested, scooting up to lean against the headboard.

Liam yawned and sat up, resting his elbows on the bed and blinking the sleep from his eyes.

“A movie sounds good to me,” Emma agreed. She got up and stepped past Nolan, letting her fingertips brush against his. On her way into the bathroom, she noticed her discarded panties lying on the floor near Nolan’s blanket and quickly bent over to pick them up.

Liam made a startled sound. Zoya glanced in his direction to see his eyes practically bugging out of his head. He’d clearly just caught a look at Emma’s bare backside. Maybe even a glimpse of her pussy, from how red he was turning.

Zoya cleared her throat, and he shot her a guilty look, realizing he’d been caught peeping. When her only response was to give him a knowing wink, he seemed flustered and busied himself digging for clean clothes in his bag.

The theater wasn’t too crowded, Zoya was pleased to note. The boys had picked some obnoxious big-budget thing with cars and spies. That was fine because she had no intention of watching it. She had her own entertainment planned, and it involved finding seats away from everyone else, including Emma and Nolan.

“Let’s sit toward the middle,” Nolan announced confidently, already walking with his popcorn.

“We’re going to sit up there,” Zoya replied, gesturing to the back of the room. Emma grinned and went after Nolan.

“All the way up here?” Liam asked, following her to the last seat in the last row, in the furthest corner of the room. The view of the screen was terrible. No one was sitting anywhere near them.

“Is that alright?” Zoya asked, smiling and adjusting her skirt.

“Uh, yeah,” he replied, glancing at the screen and then at her. “Totally.”

“Oh look,” she giggled as the lights dimmed. “The armrests fold up.” She scooted closer, pulling his arm over her shoulder.

While the trailers played, Zoya started idly running a finger up and down his thigh. He caressed her upper arm as she leaned against him. When the lights finally turned all the way off as the movie started, she brushed her lips against his ear.

“I saw you looking at Emma this morning,” she murmured. He started to object, but she put a finger to his lips. “Shh. Did you catch a glimpse of her pussy when she bent over?” He stiffened, unsure how to answer. “She’s sexy, isn’t she? It’s okay, I think so, too.” Slowly, he nodded.

“I had fun with you in the ocean yesterday,” she purred, moving her hand down his chest. “I saw you checking me out. When I took my top off. That night at dinner.” Lower, over his abdomen. “The whole time you were teaching me to surf. You couldn’t keep your eyes off my body.” Even lower, over his shorts. “And when I found you hard, all I wanted to do was touch you.” He jumped as she caressed the outline of his cock.

“But here’s a secret, Liam. By that time, I was already turned on. Do you want to know why?” He nodded and squeezed her shoulder.

“Because the night before, Emma woke me up when she climbed out of bed. I watched her rub Nolan’s cock while he sucked on her nipples. Then she straddled his leg and humped his thigh until he came in her hand. She licked it all up.” Liam groaned, and she felt his erection swelling under her palm.

“So that’s why I was ready to go yesterday. And that’s why I don’t blame you for checking Emma out.” She rubbed his cock more firmly, and nibbled on his earlobe. He gasped and squirmed. “Do you want to know why she wasn’t wearing any underwear this morning?” He nodded, frantically.

“Last night, Emma climbed out of bed again. I watched her go down on Nolan.” Liam made a strangled sound and humped against her palm. “She kneeled next to him and wrapped her lips around him. She looked so fucking sexy doing it. And from Nolan’s reaction, I think she’s good, too. He was lifting his hips, just like you’re doing, pushing deeper into her mouth.”

“Oh, Liam, I was so fucking horny.” She unbuttoned his shorts, reaching inside to wrap her hand around his firm shaft. “I couldn’t help it. I started touching myself as I watched them. It was so hard to stay quiet. Especially when Nolan took off her panties and pulled her leg over his head so he could go down on her at the same time.” Liam grunted, and she felt a squirt of precum against her palm.

“Mmm, does that turn you on?” Zoya licked his neck. “It made me cum. I had to bite Emma’s pillow to keep quiet. He had his fingers inside her and his tongue on her clit. She came all over his face when he shot his load down her throat.”

“Fuck, Zoya!” he whispered. “Please…”

“Please, what?” she whispered urgently in his ear. “Tell me. Tell me what you want me to do.”

“Use your mouth…”

“No, say it, Nolan.” She rubbed faster. “Say it!”

“Suck my cock!”

Excitedly, she helped him scoot his shorts lower. He gasped as she wrapped her lips around his head and pulled him into the heat of her mouth. His hand was on the back of her head, and he was lifting his hips, already desperate for more. She moaned happily and swallowed him.

His cock was throbbing against her tongue. She relaxed her throat, and tried to let him go deeper. It was clear he wouldn’t be able to last long. She squeezed her thighs together and pulled back, bobbing her head up and down, swirling her tongue against the tip. He grunted, his cock twitched, and she tasted his precum, like a promise.

“Ah! Zoya! Fuck,” he groaned quietly. “I want to cum in your mouth!”

A wave of lust flooded her. She redoubled her efforts, squeezing the base of his shaft, slurping greedily, desperate to make him explode. It excited her to know that no one but Liam could hear the wet sounds she was making. Suddenly, his legs stiffened and he moaned.

His cock twitched repeatedly as he flooded her mouth with hot cum. She swallowed again and again, deliriously happy. He rocked back and forth until finally, he collapsed against his seat, panting as she let him slip from between her lips.

Without hesitating, she pulled up her skirt, braced her legs on the seat in front of her, and started eagerly rubbing her clit. Liam watched, amazed. She hadn’t worn any panties to the movie, and her wetness coated her lips and thighs. She’d been turned on all day, and with his taste still on her tongue, she knew she would cum quickly.

“Put your fingers in me,” she groaned.

He wasted no time, leaning closer and slipping two between her swollen lips. She gasped and rubbed faster.

“Yes, yes, fuck me!”

He pushed his fingers deeper, pulling them out and sliding them slowly back in. It felt good, but she needed more.

“Harder,” she moaned.

He moved faster, thrusting in and out, fucking her. She closed her eyes. This was it. Fast and frantic and insistent. The pressure built in waves, more and more intense, until finally, they crashed, and she came, hard. Her insides clenched around his fingers until she pushed him away, rocking in place as the aftershocks washed over her.

When her vision finally cleared, Liam was staring at her, awestruck. She beamed at him.

“Fuck, Zoya…”

“Hmmm,” she sighed happily. “Maybe tonight. Right now, I’m too sensitive.”

“What?”

“You heard me,” she grinned. “Put your cock away, watch the movie, and I’ll think about fucking you tonight.”

He nodded, and buttoned up his shorts as Zoya snuggled up against him.
