“I’ve decided you’re right, Zoya.” Emma was walking arm-in-arm with her friend on the beach. The rain had finally cleared up, and the four of them were walking back to
the hotel from the beachfront taco stand where they’d had dinner.

“Naturally,” Zoya grinned. “What am I right about this time?” She shielded her eyes against the sunset and squinted ahead to where the boys had run off, like puppies with too much energy.

“About vacation flings, and doing what feels right, and not overthinking things.”

“Excellent! So, what are you trying not to overthink?”

“I’m going all the way with Nolan tonight,” Emma grinned.

“Hey, great minds think alike! I decided to let Liam fuck me tonight, too!”

“Yeah?” Emma giggled. “Was that before or after the movie?”

“Oh, was there a movie playing?” Zoya laughed. “I didn’t notice.”

“I knew it! When you headed off to the back of the theater, I knew you two were going to fool around.”

“What about you two?”

“Uh, we made out a little, and he put his hand up my shirt, but there were people sitting near us, and I was too nervous to do anything more.”

“You should have sat in the back, like us. As soon as the lights turned out, I started whispering in his ear and rubbing his cock. I told him how turned on I’ve been since watching you and Nolan.”

“You told him?” Emma blushed. “I feel like I should be mad, but…”

“But, you want to know how he reacted?”

“Yes!” Emma laughed. “Is that weird? I’m not used to thinking about Liam that way.”

“It’s not weird! And judging by how hard he got, he’s got no problem thinking of you that way.”

“I think that might’ve had more to do with you than me, but go on.”

“All I know is the way he begged me to suck his cock left me dripping. As soon as I swallowed, I hitched up my skirt and told him to finger me while I rubbed my clit. I came almost as fast as he did.”

“Fuck, Zoya!”

“That’s what he said!” she laughed. “I told him I’d think about it, but really, I’d already made up my mind.”

“Wait,” Emma frowned. “Tonight, when I climb down to have sex with Nolan…”

“I’ll also be getting down to ride Liam.”

“So, we’ll both be having sex on the floor on opposite sides of the bed? That seems silly. If we’re not trying to keep it secret anymore, why don’t we just use the bed?”

“I don’t think the boys are _quite_ ready to do it together,” Zoya grinned. “But I bet we’ll get them there before this trip is over. For tonight, keep pretending like you don’t want me or Liam to hear.”

“Hmm…”

“You’re thinking about it, aren’t you?”

“What?”

“You’re imagining all of us having sex on the bed at the same time. Maybe you and I are touching a little? Maybe I’m sucking on your nipples while the boys fuck us both?”

“Sounds like you’re the one who’s thinking about it.”

“Oh, I definitely am. Best. Vacation. Ever!”

As they got ready for bed, it was unclear to Emma how much the boys were aware of the sexual tension in the room. She caught a few flirty looks from Nolan, and she spotted Liam watching Zoya hopefully, but otherwise they stuck to their normal routines.

For her part, the anticipation was exciting. She and Zoya had a whispered conversation in the bathroom about what to wear. In the end, she wore Zoya’s satin nightie again, with no underwear.

“Why bother with panties?” Zoya quipped, buttoning up her nightshirt. “I’m not. You’re just gonna get them wet and take them off. Save yourself the trouble.”

Getting into bed meant walking past Nolan, who was already lying down. She got a thrill out of giving him a wink and letting him have a peek up her nightie as she climbed under the covers. He licked his lips hungrily, which made her blush, but also caused a flutter of desire in her core.

Zoya turned out the light and got into bed beside her, eyes glinting with excitement. Emma felt like she was vibrating with nervous energy. Zoya gently tucked a strand of red hair behind Emma’s ear and reached under the covers to squeeze her hand. She appreciated the encouragement, but this time she didn’t need it.

Following an impulse, Emma leaned forward and kissed Zoya. Her friend seemed surprised, but quickly melted into the kiss. Emma quietly moved closer, tangling their legs together. She teased her tongue between Zoya’s lips, and the kiss became more passionate. Zoya squirmed and grabbed Emma’s ass, pulling their bodies together. At last, Emma playfully bit Zoya’s lower lip and rolled away.

Peeking over the edge of the bed, she was pleased to see Nolan gazing up at her. He’d already kicked his sheet off, and was idly rubbing himself through his boxers. Emma waggled her eyebrows at him and gestured with her chin for him to take them off. He did so, revealing that he wasn’t quite hard yet. Emma was eager to feel him get turned on.

She slipped out of bed and dropped to lie along his side. She wrapped her hand around his cock and let herself be pulled into a kiss. Unable to resist comparing, she noticed that his lips weren’t as soft as Zoya’s. His stubble rubbed against her in a way that wasn’t unpleasant. He seemed more urgent, almost demanding, in the way he kissed her, sucking on her bottom lip. She realized with some surprise that while she was excited to have sex with him, he wasn’t as good a kisser as Zoya.

She broke away from the kiss so she could look down at his cock rapidly stiffening in her hand. It pulsed with his heartbeat as she massaged it to life. Nolan sucked on her neck, panting a bit as she started stroking harder, rubbing her palm up and down the full length of his shaft. When she saw the first drop of precum appear, she didn’t hesitate to move down and lick it up.

When she took him into her mouth, he gasped and lifted his hips, wanting more. She pushed him down, wanting to be in control. Slowly, methodically, she started bobbing her head, taking him a little deeper each time, until he was bumping against the back of her mouth.

While she was doing that, her free hand was busy between her thighs. She spread her lips, and dipped her fingers. It felt good to spread her creamy wetness over her lips. She teased her clit as his cock throbbed in her mouth, and imagined how good it would feel to guide him inside. She gave him one last suck and released him, leaving him hard and wet and desperate for more.

Emma rolled onto her back, spreading her legs and pulling his arm so he’d roll on top of her. She reached down and guided his erection to slide against her. She gasped as he settled his weight between her thighs. He rocked in place, grinding his pelvis against her.

“Suck on my nipples,” she breathed. He scooted a bit lower and eagerly slipped the skinny straps off her shoulders, pulling the front of the nightie down to expose her chest. She felt her insides clench as he pulled her breast into his mouth. Sparks danced down her spine as his tongue flicked against her nipples.

His weight felt so good between her legs as he continued to grind against her. She squirmed, dripping with arousal as his cock prodded her bottom. He switched back and forth between her nipples, squeezing one and licking the other. She ran her hands over his shoulders and through his hair, full of excitement for what was about to happen.

“Nolan,” she gasped, “I want you inside me.”

“Yeah?” He looked up, still squeezing her breasts.

“Yeah,” she urged, pulling him up, and reaching down to position his head between her lips. “Please…”

Nolan didn’t hesitate, slipping inside easily. He grunted, and she inhaled as he suddenly filled her. He lowered himself onto his elbows, buried his face in her shoulder and kissed her neck. She wrapped her legs around him, holding him in place.

“Your pussy is so hot,” he breathed in her ear.

“Fuck me,” she begged.

Immediately, he started moving. She held on, digging her fingernails into his back as he thrust with increasing passion. He sucked harder on her neck. She knew he was going to leave a mark, but didn’t care. He was deep, and with each thrust, he seemed to go deeper. She squeezed, clenching her pussy around him, and Nolan groaned into her neck.

She tangled her fingers in his hair and pulled him roughly into a kiss. Suddenly, his urgent kissing felt right, and his rough stubble didn’t bother her so much. Eagerly, she sucked on his tongue when he pushed it between her lips. Flares of colored light were dancing at the edge of her vision with each thrust, but abruptly he pulled away, rocking back on his knees and slipping out of her.

He held up his hand, indicating that he needed a minute. She watched, fascinated, as he gripped his cock tightly, as though trying to restrain it. He grimaced, like he was holding something back, and his cock twitched several times in his hand. Despite how tightly he was squeezing, a squirt of precum dripped down his fingers. A moment later, he relaxed his grip and grinned at her. She got up on her knees and leaned in to whisper in his ear.

“Was that for me?”

“Yeah, I was about to cum. You feel so good.”

“I want it,” she breathed, feeling a surge of excitement. “I want you to cum for me.”

“I will, I just didn’t want to be done so fast.”

“Get behind me!”

Eagerly, Emma dropped to her hands and knees. Nolan moved forward, and she gasped as he rubbed his cock against her until he found her opening and pushed back inside. This was her favorite. When a guy was behind her, something about the angles worked better. It felt like they could reach deeper, and every movement stimulated her more. She could usually come like this, especially if she rubbed her clit.

Nolan grabbed her and started thrusting. It felt delicious. She buried her face in his pillow to avoid making any noise. For a moment, he froze, as if startled by something, but then he started fucking her harder. She tried not to squeal as he squeezed her hips tighter, driving toward his climax.

After a minute, she couldn’t hold her noises in anymore, and just hoped the pillow was muffling her cries of pleasure. Zoya would probably hear her and approve, or even egg her on, wanting her to get louder. Could Liam hear her? She imagined looking up over the bed and seeing Liam watching her, mouth open in shock. She did squeal, then, as her cunt clenched tightly around Nolan’s cock. He grunted and kept fucking her.

She pictured Liam sitting before her, furiously masturbating to the sight of her getting fucked. Panting with each thrust, she got up on her hands again. She imagined Liam coming closer, rubbing his cock in front of her until neither of them could resist. Suddenly desperate for something to suck on, she shoved two fingers in her mouth, pushing deep and wishing it was Liam’s cock. She imagined him using her mouth as eagerly as Nolan was using her pussy.

Nolan groaned, much louder than she expected, and for a moment, she wondered if he knew about her fantasy, and it was getting him off, too. She moaned around her fingers as his cock swelled inside her. She knew he was close.

“Emma,” he gasped, “where?”

Excited, she spun around, popping him out of her. She knelt in front of him and looked up as he started stroking his cock.

“Cum on my tits,” she urged.

Nolan looked down at her, eyes full of lust. Then he glanced to the side. She followed his gaze and saw Zoya, clearly riding Liam, who was hidden by the bed. Zoya had her tits in her hands and bounced in place, eyes closed, mouth open in ecstasy. Emma couldn’t tell if she’d just cum or was about to. She heard Liam make a strangled sound, and Zoya let out a long, low moan as she froze, absorbed in the sensation of Liam cumming inside her. She opened her eyes, saw Emma and Nolan watching, and grinned happily at them.

Nolan grunted and Emma felt the first hot splash of cum on her chest. He was staring at her again and frantically stroking his cock. She squealed as his body rocked in place, shooting cum all over her breasts. The wanton look in his eyes made her insides clench repeatedly.

At last, Nolan collapsed onto his back, still holding his cock and panting as the last of his orgasm rolled through his body.

Emma leaned against the bed, head swimming with arousal. She squeezed her nipples, sending lightning crackling through her system. Before she could decide to ask Nolan to help her cum, she felt Zoya climb onto the bed.

Her friend laughed and pulled her up to lay on her back. She gasped as Zoya immediately began licking all the cum from her chest. Emma reached between her legs and found her clit, swollen with need.

“Fuck, you two are hot,” Zoya mumbled around her nipple.

“Zee! Oh, God, you’re gonna make me cum.”

Emma looked down, and saw Nolan sitting up, watching the two of them with awe in his eyes. She spread her legs so he had a better view of her pussy and started rubbing tight circles around her clit. Zoya continued, loudly slurping up all of Nolan’s cum.

She looked to the other side of the bed and wasn’t surprised to find Liam watching as well. The hunger she saw in his eyes made her shiver with excitement. She couldn’t believe Liam was looking at her like that, watching his two friends writhe on the bed. She rubbed her clit faster and moaned as she remembered her fantasy. If Liam stood up right now with an erection, she would eagerly swallow him. She wondered if he could see how turned on she was by the thought.

Zoya, having apparently licked up all the cum, started moving down Emma’s body, kissing her stomach, licking her hips, nuzzling her hand out of the way. Emma moaned at Liam as Zoya wrapped her lips around her clit.

“Oh fuck, Liam,” she gasped. “She’s sucking my clit!”

Liam licked his lips and watched as Zoya pushed Emma over the edge.

“Zee! Ah! Fuck, I’m cumming, I’m cumming, I’m cumming!”

Emma closed her eyes and saw fireworks.
