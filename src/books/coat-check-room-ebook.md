_The Coat Check Room_ brings you three steamy short stories from author Ruby Pink exploring domination and submission. “The Queen of Marketing” acts out a longtime fantasy by dominating the insufferable head of another department. In “Shower Surprise,” a man is caught in an indiscreet moment by his impatient coworker when he forgets to lock the door to the office shower room. And in the titular “Coat Check Room,” a coat check girl takes great delight in telling her companion about her journey into the world of submissiveness, teasing him mercilessly, until his boss catches them.

Ruby Pink loves reading erotica but was frustrated to find so many featuring shallow women with no agency. She took up the pen to bring us steamy shorts about real women who aren’t just props in male fantasies.
