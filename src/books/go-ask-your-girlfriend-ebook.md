In _Go Ask Your Girlfriend!_, author Ruby Pink brings you four steamy short stories about women who know what they want. “Meet Me in the Supply Closet” is about an illicit encounter in the office that isn’t what it first appears to be. “Whoops, Wrong Number” tells the story of a woman whose unintentionally seductive text turns into a memorable exchange. “Rainy Day at the Shop” is about two bored employees finding a way to entertain them selves on a slow day. And in the titular “Go Ask Your Girlfriend,” Heather agrees to teach Jimmy a few things about women.

Ruby Pink loves reading erotica but was frustrated to find so many featuring shallow women with no agency. She took up the pen to bring us steamy shorts about real women who aren’t just props in male fantasies.
