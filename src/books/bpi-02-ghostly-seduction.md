Special Agent Gillian Reid of the Bureau of Paranormal Investigation is in Rhode Island to investigate a haunting. Nearly a century ago, a pair of lovers committed suicide at a famous hotel on their wedding night. Now the staff is being driven away by a ghost and the new owner is desperate for help.

Reid’s partner is convinced the whole thing is a hoax, but she soon finds herself face-to-face with the spirit. Now she will do whatever it takes to help this grieving spirit move on, even if it means entering the ghost’s memories to give him the wedding night he missed out on!
