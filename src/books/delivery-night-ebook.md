_Delivery Night_ brings you three erotic paranormal stories from author Ruby Pink. In “The Moaning Ghost” a ghost hunter attempts to help an apparition with some unresolved earthly desires. “What Happens on Treaty Station” shares the story of an ambassador’s illicit encounters with a reclusive species at an outpost on the edge of human space. And in the title story, “Delivery Night,” a pizza delivery driver discovers why his coworker warned him not to go inside, even if the woman who answers the door invites him in.

Ruby Pink loves reading erotica but was frustrated to find so many featuring shallow women with no agency. She took up the pen to bring us steamy shorts about real women who aren’t just props in male fantasies.
