Emma couldn’t believe it. The tropical vacation she’d been looking forward to all year was here! After three years apart, she was reunited with her friends Zoya and Liam… Plus Liam’s handsome surfer cousin, Nolan. But now a problem with the reservations will force the four of them to share a room with just one bed. Will this be a disaster… or the start of the best vacation ever?
