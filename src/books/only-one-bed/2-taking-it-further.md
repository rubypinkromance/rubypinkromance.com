When Emma found out that she and her three friends would have to share a room with just one bed, she was convinced it would ruin their tropical vacation. However, the close quarters had unexpected benefits, and she surprised herself by fooling around with hunky surfer Nolan. That passionate moment was memorable, but despite her best friend Zoya’s encouragement, Emma isn’t sure if she should take things further. Will she push Nolan away, or take things further and make this the best vacation ever?
