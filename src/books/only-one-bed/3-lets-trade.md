Emma’s tropical vacation with her friends hasn’t exactly gone according to plan, but she can’t complain. Forced to share a room with only one bed led her to make a passionate connection with hunky surfer Nolan, and her best friend Zoya hooked up with Nolan’s cousin Liam. Things were going really well until she discovers Liam fantasizing about her in the shower. She expected the Zoya would be upset, but she only laughed and suggested they trade guys. Will Emma be able to follow Zoya’s lead to make this the best vacation ever?
