_Relieving the Tension_ brings you five steamy short stories from author Ruby Pink about women who know what they want. In “Can You Teach Me?” Alice asks her roommate for advice on improving her dirty talk. “We Have to Be Quiet” is a hot first-time story about a couple trying not to wake anyone up on a squeaky twin bed. “Oh, Mr. Johnson!” is about a babysitter who wants more from her employer. In “Are Those My…?” Rachel catches her roommate’s boyfriend in a compromising position. And in the title story, two coworkers need to find a way to relieve some erotic tension before their big presentation.

Ruby Pink loves reading erotica but was frustrated to find so many featuring shallow women with no agency. She took up the pen to bring us steamy shorts about real women who aren’t just props in male fantasies.
