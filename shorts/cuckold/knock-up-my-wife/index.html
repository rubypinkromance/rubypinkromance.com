  <div class="publication__content short__content">
    <p>I wasn’t surprised when Sandra invited me over for “dinner.” I’d spotted her and her friend on the treadmills looking my way while I was doing squats. They laughed and pretended they weren’t checking me out. I caught her eye a couple more times before she finally worked up the nerve to come over, blushing like a new bride.</p>
<p>This happens all the time. You’d be shocked how many horny women are at the gym, and my shorts don’t leave much to the imagination. Of course, that works both ways. As she approached, I admired the curves contained within her sports bra and leggings.</p>
<p>We exchanged numbers, and I said I’d love to come over for a bite. Like I said, I wasn’t surprised.</p>
<p>I <em>was</em> surprised when I arrived at her place and her husband answered the door. I mentally cursed and prepared to make an excuse why I was there, when he invited me in.</p>
<p>“You must be Rick,” he said, sizing me up as he opened the door wide. “Come on in, Sandra’s got our dinner ready.”</p>
<p>The dude was short, round, and had a receding hairline. He reminded me of a weasel, with a smile that didn’t reach his eyes, looking like he’d caught me on my way to seduce his wife. Which was accurate, but still made me dislike him on sight.</p>
<p>He led me into the dining room, and gestured for me to sit. The vibe was super weird. I considered cutting my losses and just walking out the door, but before I could make up my mind, Sandra skipped into the room wearing an apron. She threw her arms around me and leaned in for a hug, pressing her chest against mine.</p>
<p>“I’m so glad you’re here,” she gushed when she let me go. “I was worried you wouldn’t come.” She caught me shooting a confused glance at her husband and laughed, squeezing my bicep. “Oh, don’t worry about Fred, he always looks like that. He’s glad you’re here, too.”</p>
<p>He sneered in a way that made me doubt that very much, but gestured again for me to sit. Confused, I took my seat and watched as Sandra brought out the meal. She set plates of healthy food for me and her. Chicken breast, quinoa, and spinach salad. In front of her husband, she set a heaping plate of lasagna, steaming and oozing melted cheese. He immediately tucked in, while Sandra hung up her apron and sat across from me.</p>
<p>I picked at my food and struggled through some truly painful small talk. I wasn’t hungry because I hadn’t thought we would actually be eating dinner. Fred took a long time to explain what he did for a living. Something confusing with computers and stocks. That explained their house, at least. Tastefully decorated (by Sandra, no doubt) and big enough for a family of five, though it was just them.</p>
<p>As I pushed some chicken around my plate, I was startled to feel Sandra’s foot caressing my leg. I looked up to find her licking her lips and staring at me with clear hunger in her eyes. Her husband continued to blather on, oblivious, as her foot moved higher.</p>
<p>“Anyway, enough about the market.” Fred rested his elbows on the table and raised an eyebrow conspiratorially. “Rick, you must be curious why you’re here?”</p>
<p>“For dinner?” I said, dumbly, squeezing my knees around Sandra’s foot to stop her advances.</p>
<p>“Ha! Indeed. But more than that. You see, my wife and I have a favor to ask you.”</p>
<p>Oh, shit. They wanted a threesome. I glanced at Sandra, who bit her lip and continued struggling to touch my cock under the table. Fred grinned slyly. I started preparing to let them down gently and get the fuck out. Sandra looked like fun, but I wasn’t interested in seeing Fred naked.</p>
<p>“It’s like this. Sandra wants a baby, and the doctor recently told me I’m impotent.”</p>
<p>“Oh?” I was thrown enough to drop my guard for a moment, which was long enough for Sandra to wriggle her foot between my thighs. She raised her eyebrows in triumph when she finally felt my bulge.</p>
<p>“Yeah, just one of those things, you know?” He shrugged. “Still, I’d do anything for my girl. She wants a baby? She’s getting a baby. But we’re not going to the clinic and getting some random spunk. I wanna know the source, if you know what I mean. So I asked her if she knew anyone who might make a good donor.”</p>
<p>“And I said,” she grinned, “there’s a guy at the gym they call Big-Dick Rick.”</p>
<p>I shot her a look. She responded by rubbing her sole against my cock, as if to say, “and now I know it’s true.”</p>
<p>“So I told her,” Fred continued, unaware, “invite him over and let me look him in the eye. Now you’re here, and I can see you fit the bill. So, here’s the deal, slick. If we’re gonna do this, I got two conditions.”</p>
<p>“Uh, conditions?” I struggled to focus on what he was saying as Sandra slouched lower in her chair to more vigorously rub against me.</p>
<p>“First, I’m gonna watch.”</p>
<p>“Uh, wait, what?” I grabbed her foot, trying to hold her still, but she just pushed harder. “You want to watch?”</p>
<p>“No, I said I’m <em>going</em> to watch. I’d rather not see another guy fuck my wife, but if it has to happen, I’m damn sure gonna monitor the situation. Make sure you keep it professional and don’t get carried away, ya know?”</p>
<p>“Right, I guess that makes sense,” I lied. “Professional.”</p>
<p>“Second, you gotta do it in the butt.”</p>
<p>“The butt?” I couldn’t keep the confusion from my face. “But that—”</p>
<p>“—is going to take a lot longer to get pregnant.” Sandra cut me off, grinning. “I warned him.”</p>
<p>“I know, I know, but you’re my wife,” he gestured dismissively. “It’s not right for another man to get to fuck you in the front. I don’t care if it takes more attempts. You two’ll do it from the rear, and that’s final.”</p>
<p>My jaw was on the floor. Were they playing a prank on me? He wanted me to get his wife pregnant with anal sex? Could Fred really be this clueless about basic biology? I looked between the two of them.</p>
<p>Fred crossed his arms, satisfied that he’d set the terms for the engagement and was therefore in control. Sandra just winked.</p>
<p>Oh my God. He really had no clue, and she was taking full advantage.</p>
<p>“So,” she asked, “are you in?”</p>
<p>I thought about saying no. It was the smart move. This situation was fucked. How would Fred react when Sandra didn’t get pregnant? How many times would he watch me fuck her before he figured it out? He looked like the kind of guy who kept a gun in the house for self-defense, and was looking for an excuse to use it.</p>
<p>On the other hand, my cock was quickly swelling as Sandra continued to rub it. I’d come here expecting to get lucky, and judging by the look in her eyes, she was gagging for it. Seemed rude to go home without letting her say hello. Plus, he <em>wanted</em> me to do it. We weren’t sneaking around, exactly. Sandra bit her lip and put more pressure against my shaft.</p>
<p>“Fuck it,” I shrugged. “I’m in.”</p>
<p>“Nice,” Sandra smiled. “I’m going to go get ready. Give me fifteen minutes before you come up. Fred, sweetie, why don’t you get Rick here a bit of the good stuff?”</p>
<p>“Uh, sure,” Fred said, barely suppressing a scowl as she gave him a kiss on the cheek and practically skipped out of the room. He walked to a well-stocked bar cart and poured two small glasses of dark brown liquid. I don’t know shit about whiskey, but judging by the look on his face, “the good stuff” wasn’t cheap. He looked a lot more jealous of me drinking his liquor than fucking his wife.</p>
<p>I took a sip. It burned going down. Fred watched expectantly. I tried to evaluate the flavor, thinking of something intelligent to say, but it tasted like every other whiskey I’ve ever had.</p>
<p>“Um, smoky,” I ventured. “Complex.”</p>
<p>Fred nodded, satisfied with my response. He inhaled deeply from his glass before taking a sip, closing his eyes to savor the experience. Then he proceeded to tell me about the types of barrels it was made in for fifteen excruciating minutes.</p>
<p>“Okay, boys, I’m ready!” Sandra called from upstairs.</p>
<p>Gratefully, I discarded my glass on the table and followed the sound of her voice. Fred followed hot on my heels, as if he were afraid to leave us alone for even a minute.</p>
<p>The master bedroom was impressive. The ceilings were astonishingly high, and tall windows let in the pink glow of the sunset. One door led to a bathroom, and another to a walk-in closet. Of course, my eyes were drawn to the king-size bed, and the gorgeous woman waiting for me.</p>
<p>Sandra had changed into some fancy lingerie. She was wearing something like a corset, with cups that barely covered her breasts. The straps of her thong rode high over her hips, and drew my eye down her curves. Pleased to see me looking, she licked her lips seductively.</p>
<p>Fred trailed me into the room, and made his way over to a chair placed in the far corner. He leaned back and continued to sip his whiskey, doing his best to look like he was in charge. I ignored him completely as Sandra crawled to the foot of the bed, gesturing for me to come closer.</p>
<p>As I approached, she got to her knees and put her hands on my chest. I unbuttoned my shirt, and she purred appreciatively, reaching inside to feel my pectoral muscles. While I shrugged my shirt off and let it fall to the floor, she was already reaching lower. When she ran her fingers over my shaft, she grinned.</p>
<p>“I’m eager to see what you’re packing.”</p>
<p>She continued to rub and fondle me as I undid my belt and pants. Eagerly, she helped me push them down until my cock popped out, drawing a surprised intake of breath. I wasn’t hard yet, but I was getting there, and I’m used to this reaction. I kicked my shoes aside and finished undressing as she sized me up, imagining it erect, and how it would feel inside her.</p>
<p>“What do you think?” I grinned, wrapping one hand around the base and casually stroking it for her.</p>
<p>“It’s so much bigger than…” She trailed off, eyes darting towards her husband. He leaned forward, elbows on his knees, too distracted to notice her comment. She wasn’t the only one impressed.</p>
<p>As I continued to stroke, she got closer, shamelessly fascinated. Cautiously, she reached out to touch it, and I let her take over. Slowly, she pumped up and down the length of it, feeling it grow in her hand. Closer and closer she moved, until it was almost touching her cheek as she inhaled my scent.</p>
<p>She looked up, as her lips brushed against me. I nodded, and she began to kiss up the length of my shaft. I was mostly hard now, and inhaled with anticipation as her tongue flicked out to tease my foreskin. When she finally parted her lips around the tip, I sighed happily and ran my fingers through her hair.</p>
<p>She eagerly set to work, determined to see how much of me she could take. Her lips sealed as she sucked my head into the heat of her mouth. Her tongue swirled around, and flicked against my opening. I groaned as she started to bob her head, still stroking as I throbbed to life, until my skin was stretched taut, and she was licking around the sensitive ridge.</p>
<p>I wrapped a hand around the back of her head, encouraging her to continue. She moaned happily as I pushed deeper. I bumped the back of her throat, and she struggled not to gag. God, she was good at this. I had a suspicion that Sandra had a wild past before she’d gotten married. As if sensing that thought, she reached under my balls and let a finger tickle my back door. I moaned loudly, and parted my legs, pushing a bit more enthusiastically, until she was forced to pull back, coughing.</p>
<p>She looked up at me with eyes full of lust, still pumping one hand on my throbbing shaft. Her chin was sloppy with drool, dripping down onto her cleavage. I growled and shoved my cock back in her mouth. She forced herself forward, taking me as deep as she could. She managed to take probably half my length. Her jaw was straining wide around my girth, but she was determined, moaning excitedly and rocking her head to work me deeper.</p>
<p>“Aren’t you getting a little carried away there, dear?” Her husband’s voice surprised us both. She released me with a loud slurp, suppressing a guilty expression as she looked back at him.</p>
<p>“Sorry, sweetie, but you know it has to be rock hard for anal. Remember that night when you couldn’t—”</p>
<p>“Yes, yes, I get it,” he cut her off. “But he looks plenty ready to me.”</p>
<p>“I suppose you’re right,” she said, just a little sadly.</p>
<p>She let me go, and crawled toward the head of the bed, rummaging in a nightstand drawer before popping back up with an expensive-looking bottle of lube. Slipping off her thong, she took one squirt of the lube, then hesitated, looked at my cock, and added another before reaching discreetly behind herself to apply it.</p>
<p>She watched me stroking myself for her, and bit her lip before turning around and bending over on her hands and knees. I couldn’t help but grin as I stepped into position behind her, savoring the sight of her sopping wet pussy and rear.</p>
<p>Not many women let me fuck their asses, for understandable reasons. I ran my hand over the curve of her buttock, and teased my fingers between her lips. She shivered and arched her back as I rested my thumb against her tightly clenched opening. Gently, reassuringly, I rubbed in a tight circle until she shuddered and relaxed, lowering her head to the sheets.</p>
<p>Slowly, I pressed the tip of my thumb inward. She moaned and involuntarily tightened around the intruder. Undeterred, I worked the tip in and out, until once again she unclenched, and my thumb slipped fully inside. She groaned and rocked back against my hand. I rewarded her by curling my two fingers inside her pussy upward, until I could feel the shape of my thumb.</p>
<p>I stroked my cock and started fingering her. She rocked back and forth, and after a moment, I felt her reach between her thighs to rub her clit.</p>
<p>Fred was watching curiously as his wife panted with desire, another man’s thumb stuffed in her ass. I knew right away he’d never done this to her. I could tell that for him, if it didn’t involve his cock, he wasn’t interested. Let him watch. Maybe he’d learn something. I never put my cock into a woman until she’s already creamed all over my fingers. They always think they’re ready, but they’re not.</p>
<p>“Oh fuck,” she moaned into the mattress. “Oh fuck. Oh fuck. Oh fuck! Oh! Oh God!” I felt her insides start to clench around my fingers, and she rocked back more desperately. “Oh my God! Oh fuck!” I felt her juices leaking around my fingers, and my thumb was plunging in and out of her ass without resistance. “I’m gonna cum! I’m gonna cum, I’m gonna cum, I’m cummming!” She screamed with obvious surprise as I held my fingers deep inside, letting her squeeze them as the first orgasm tore through her.</p>
<p>When she finally released her grip on the sheets and her breathing slowed, I let my thumb slip out, followed by my fingers. She shuddered and cursed, but when she felt me move closer, she reached back to spread her cheeks for me.</p>
<p>“Oh yes,” she groaned, “I’m ready.”</p>
<p>I pressed the tip of my cock against her back door. Even with her relaxed after an orgasm, it was a tight fit. I pressed hard, trying to work my head inside. She started to tense up, and I paused for a moment, stroking her back until she exhaled. Then I tried again, straining as she slowly spread to accommodate me.</p>
<p>“Oooh fuck.” She moaned, long and low, as little by little, I continued pushing forward. “Fuuuck!” It was difficult, but the lube and pressure did the work. “Aaah!”</p>
<p>She screamed as I finally popped past her opening. Inside, she was slick and hot, and gripped me tightly. I held her hips, keeping still until she got used to me. I wanted badly to start thrusting, but I forced myself to hold back, give her time. Even so, my cock throbbed excitedly.</p>
<p>“Jesus Christ,” she gasped. “You’re so big. Oh fuck. Oh it’s so big inside me.”</p>
<p>“You’re so tight,” I growled.</p>
<p>“Oh fuck. Oh fuck. Oh fuck,” she repeated. “Is it all the way in?”</p>
<p>“That’s just the tip,” I laughed.</p>
<p>“Just the tip? Oh fuck!” I felt her clench in alarm.</p>
<p>“Relax,” I soothed her, stroking her spine. “That was the hardest part. If you got my head in, you can take the rest, I promise.”</p>
<p>“Are you sure?” She asked, incredulously. “It already feels like you’re splitting me in half!”</p>
<p>“He’s not hurting you, is he?” her husband asked sharply, scowling at me.</p>
<p>“Oh no, baby, he’s… oh fuck… he’s just big. He’s <em>so</em> big.”</p>
<p>“That’s what you wanted, right?” Fred looked suddenly unsure of this whole endeavor. “You said a big dick meant he was virile. That he could knock you up for sure.”</p>
<p>“That’s right, sweetie,” she panted, trying to reassure him while also adjusting to the cock in her ass. “Think of the baby.”</p>
<p>“Right.” Fred nodded, and sat back in his chair. “The baby.”</p>
<p>“Sandra,” I murmured. “Remember how good you felt a minute ago?”</p>
<p>“Yeah,” she breathed.</p>
<p>“In a minute, this is gonna feel even better.”</p>
<p>“Okay,” she squeaked as I gripped her hips and started pushing slowly deeper. “Oh. Oh. Oh!”</p>
<p>“Fucking hell, woman, your ass feels so good.”</p>
<p>She could only moan in reply as I slipped deeper and deeper inside. Once I was buried about halfway, I pulled back a bit and squirted another generous dollop of lube onto my shaft, rubbing it around her opening before easing in again.</p>
<p>At last, her butt was pressing against my hips and my cock was buried entirely inside. She was gasping and panting and clawing at the sheets, murmuring curses under her breath. I groaned and held her against me. I could feel her heat wrapped around my shaft, and I was desperate to start fucking, but I forced myself to hold back and check in with her.</p>
<p>“How—ah!—are you doing, Sandra?”</p>
<p>“Is it all the way in?” She asked with a strained voice. I wondered if she was starting to second guess her plan to fuck me.</p>
<p>“Yeah, it is,” I reassured her. “You took it all.”</p>
<p>“It’s so deep,” she moaned.</p>
<p>“Are you ready?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Yesss,” she murmured into the sheet.</p>
<p>“Say it louder, Sandra,” I said, digging my fingers into her hips. “Tell me what you want.”</p>
<p>“I want you to fuck me…”</p>
<p>“Where?”</p>
<p>“My ass,” she gasped.</p>
<p>“Louder,” I insisted.</p>
<p>“I want you to fuck me in the ass,” she groaned.</p>
<p>“Say it like you mean it! Let your husband hear what you want.”</p>
<p>“Fuck me in the ass!” She shouted, arching her back.</p>
<p>I pulled back, letting my cock slip halfway out, and then pushed back in, making her squeal in surprise. Then I did it again, faster. And again. And again. With each thrust, she grunted and moaned, until I was fucking her hard, slamming the full length of my cock into her tight ass.</p>
<p>“Oh fuck! It’s so deep. I can feel it in my stomach. Oh god, babe, he’s fucking me!”</p>
<p>Fred shifted uncomfortably on the chair. His whisky was gone, and he had nothing to distract himself from the sight of his wife writhing around another man’s cock.</p>
<p>“Rub your clit,” I growled. “I want to feel you cum around my cock.”</p>
<p>“Yes! Oh, yes!” She began rubbing eagerly between her thighs, and immediately, I felt her squeezing around me, clenching excitedly.</p>
<p>I knew I wasn’t going to last long, and I had serious doubts that Fred would ever let me near Sandra again. I wanted to make the most of the experience. Without thinking about it, I reached forward, grabbed a rough handful of her hair and jerked her head back, lifting her up so she was looking directly at him.</p>
<p>“Tell him,” I ordered. “Tell him what you’re feeling.”</p>
<p>“Fuck! I’ve never had anyone this big. Baby, he’s so big. He’s so fucking deep in my ass, and every time he pushes deeper, my pussy gushes around my fingers.”</p>
<p>“That’s right, take this big cock in your tight little ass until it makes you cum screaming my name.”</p>
<p>“Hey, now,” Fred objected, getting to his feet. “You’re out of line! There’s no need to talk to her like that.”</p>
<p>“Sit your ass down,” I snarled at him. “Keep talking, Sandra,” I groaned. “Rub your horny little clit and tell your husband how good my cock feels in your tight little asshole.”</p>
<p>“Oh fuck! He’s so much bigger than you, Freddy. I’ve never felt like this before. I just keep cumming over and over. You’ve never made cum like this!”</p>
<p>“What?” He sagged in his chair, dismayed. “But… this is just for the baby, right?” he pleaded. “If he makes you cum, it’ll help you get pregnant?”</p>
<p>“Oh, Rick! Keep fucking me!” She could only scream in response as I pulled her hair harder and slammed my cock into her ass.</p>
<p>“Shut the fuck up, man, I’m about to blow my load in your wife,” I moaned. “Tell him, Sandra. Tell him how badly you want my cum.”</p>
<p>“Fucking cum in me,” she begged, shamelessly. “I want it! I want to feel you pump your hot cum deep in my ass.”</p>
<p>“Fuck!” I shouted. When I released her hair, she collapsed, burying her face in the mattress and clawing at the sheets. I thrust forward one last time, as deep as possible, and bellowed as my cock pulsed deep in the heat of her body. She cried out with each twitch, spasming around me with sympathetic mini-climaxes.</p>
<p>At last, I staggered back, my cock slipping from her body with a wet squelch. She rolled onto her side, clamping her hands over her sensitive openings and shaking with release.</p>
<p>Fred was glaring at me, with murder in his eyes. Unsure what else to do, I quickly started to pick up my clothes, ready to make a run for it.</p>
<p>“Oh wow,” she purred, rolling onto her back and cupping her stomach as if feeling a pregnancy developing. She gazed at Fred with a beatific look of unfettered joy. “Baby, I think we might have done it!”</p>
<p>“Really?” His expression quickly melted. “You think it worked?”</p>
<p>“We’ll see,” she smiled. “Now, I know that was hard for you to watch, but you need to thank Rick for his help. He did a great job.”</p>
<p>“Um, right.” He looked between her and me, a confused expression on his face. “Right.” Awkwardly, he held out his hand for a shake. “Thanks, Rick. I guess.”</p>
<p>“Uh, my pleasure.” I shook his hand, sweat dripping from my brow. “Anytime.”</p>
<p>“We may take you up on that,” she responded cheerfully. “If it doesn’t take.”</p>
<p>“Well, uh, good luck,” I stammered, backing out the door as Fred climbed into the outstretched arms of his loving wife. He was ready to believe she’d only let a stranger fuck her in the ass to get pregnant.</p>
<p>The smart thing to do would be to lose her number, change gyms, and avoid this part of town. The risk of Fred figuring out the basics of human reproduction were too high.</p>
<p>But I knew I wouldn’t. Sandra would call me again. And god help me, I was looking forward to it.</p>
