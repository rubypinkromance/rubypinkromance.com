  <div class="publication__content short__content">
    <p>“Jax, my man!” Gio looked up from assembling a pizza as I walked in the back door. “What are you doing here? I thought Omar was driving tonight?”</p>
<p>“He asked me to cover his shift,” I replied. “Said he caught something from his roommate.”</p>
<p>“Alright, well, I’ve got an order about ready to go.” He held up the receipt. “Looks like you’re heading to the Pearl district.”</p>
<p>“Ugh, I hate parking over there,” I frowned. “Wait, what’s the name on the order?”</p>
<p>“Uh… Murray? Looks like they’re a regular. Same order every week, like clockwork. Why, you know them or something?”</p>
<p>“Nah, but get a load of this. After I said I’d cover his shift, Omar got all serious. Said if I get a delivery in the Pearl for Murray, don’t go in, even if they invite me. He was real insistent.”</p>
<p>“Murray sounds like a stoner’s name.” Gio chuckled as he pulled the pizza from the oven, dropping it in a box and quickly slicing it. “Dude probably invited him in once and talked his ear off.”</p>
<p>“Knowing Omar,” I grinned, “more likely it’s some lonely housewife.”</p>
<p>“Ha!” He lapsed into a low-budget porn star impression. “Oh no, mister! I don’t have any money, but maybe I can pay you some other way?”</p>
<p>“Fingers crossed, man,” I laughed, slipping the box into a hot bag and walking out.</p>
<p>Behind the strip mall was a small parking lot. It exited to the street on one side, and on the other was a narrow alley between two buildings. The moon was hidden behind a heavy layer of clouds, and the parking lot light flickered out as I walked to my car, plunging me into darkness. Cursing, I pulled out my phone to turn on the flashlight.</p>
<p>As I did, a car turned down the side street, and its headlights briefly sliced through the parking lot. For just a second, I thought I saw a thin, pale figure in the alley. Probably a bum, I figured, as I unlocked the car and dropped the pizza on the passenger seat.</p>
<p>The engine struggled to start, complaining and straining. “Come on,” I grumbled. I’d just spent my last paycheck at the mechanic, and they swore they’d fixed the starter. For a second, the motor turned over, then sputtered and died. Before it did, the headlights caught that person in the alley again, closer than before. It looked like a woman, with short dark hair, staring right at me.</p>
<p>I peered over the dash, but there wasn’t enough light to see down the alley. Shrugging, I tried the key again, and this time the engine started. The headlights flooded the parking lot and alley with light, and there was no one there.</p>
<p>The drive to the Pearl was boring, but I kept seeing some big fucking bat flying overhead. I’ve never seen bats in the city before. Plenty of rats and pigeons, but never bats. They look weird as shit.</p>
<p>I finally found a place to park just a few blocks from the delivery address, so I felt pretty lucky when I started walking. This part of town is full of fancy bars and restaurants, so I was walking past lots of people having a fun night out. The address turned out to be an upscale apartment building. I buzzed their number, and a lady’s voice answered.</p>
<p>“Thirteenth floor, come on up,” she said, buzzing me in.</p>
<p>In the lobby was a wall of mailboxes, a doorway to the stairs, and an elevator. I pushed the button and waited, then I got that creeping sensation on the back of my neck, like someone was looking at me. I turned around, expecting to see someone looking in the window, but almost jumped out of my skin because there was someone standing right behind me.</p>
<p>“Sorry!” She apologized, holding up her keys. “Didn’t mean to scare you. I came in behind you. Guess you didn’t hear me?” She had pale skin, short-cropped black hair, and dark eyes.</p>
<p>“Uh, yeah,” I laughed nervously. “I guess not.” I was sure no one had come in after me. I hadn’t heard the door or anything, and I would have noticed if she slipped in behind me. Weird.</p>
<p>She smiled and rocked on her heels, looking at the floor readout above the elevator. I shook my head, trying to shake off an odd feeling that she was the woman I saw in the alley. But, no, that was just my mind playing tricks on me. There wasn’t anyone in the alley, remember? Besides, that was across town.</p>
<p>When the elevator finally arrived, I stepped in and pressed the button for the thirteenth floor. She followed me in, standing in the back. I looked at her, waiting to hear what button to push. “Same floor,” she remarked. Her grin seemed strangely ominous, and I tried not to shiver as I turned my back on her. Although I couldn’t see her reflection in the buffed metal walls of the elevator, I could feel her eyes on the back of my neck.</p>
<p>I left the elevator quickly, telling myself I wasn’t afraid or anything, I was just trying to deliver the pizza before it got cold. Her footsteps seemed to follow me down the hall. This was ridiculous. I couldn’t be afraid of some random woman who lived here. I took a deep breath as I approached the door and knocked, wondering who would answer that Omar had felt the need to warn me about.</p>
<p>I had to suppress a grin when a voluptuous woman in a silk robe opened the door. Her hair was dyed pink, with her nails painted to match. She smiled seductively and stepped aside, swinging the door wide, inviting me in.</p>
<p>“Oh, I, um, I’m just here with your pizza,” I stammered. Gio was never gonna believe this.</p>
<p>Before I could form a more coherent response, the woman from the elevator stepped around me into the apartment. She kissed the robed woman on the lips and sauntered in, kicking off her shoes and removing her jacket. My cheeks burned from how badly I’d misread the situation.</p>
<p>Fucking Omar, I laughed to myself. He made such a big deal of not going in, and then it turned out to just be a couple of lesbians! He must have known I’d jump to the wrong conclusion. I should have known better, this is totally the kind of prank he likes to pull. I’d have to get him back good for this.</p>
<p>“Come on in,” she said, patting her robe theatrically to show she had no pockets. “My purse is in the kitchen.”</p>
<p>I stepped in, looking around as she shut the door behind me. The apartment was pretty nice, though all their furniture was old stuff. Probably instagram types, I thought, posting videos about restoring antiques and shit. She led me through to the kitchen, where I put the pizza on the island as she picked up her purse.</p>
<p>“Eve, I’m putting on some music,” called the dark-haired woman from the next room. “What do you want?”</p>
<p>“Portishead,” she called back, before asking me with a smile, “Where’s Omar?” There was a twinkle in her eyes that made me wonder if she was in on the joke. “He’s our usual delivery guy.”</p>
<p>“Sick,” I nodded. “He called me to cover his shift.”</p>
<p>“Hmm. Are you new? I don’t think I’ve seen you before.” She licked her lips. “I’m sure I’d remember if I had.”</p>
<p>No mistaking that. She was definitely flirting. I shot a nervous glance toward the other room, where the dark-haired woman was standing by the stereo. Slow, throbbing bass rumbled from a large set of speakers, and she started swaying in place, eyes closed, vibing.</p>
<p>“I, uh, normally work the day shift.” I turned back to the robed woman, who was leaning on the other side of the island, rummaging through her purse. Her robe hung open just enough to tease the curve of her breasts. I swallowed, and tried to look away.</p>
<p>“Well, that explains it. Mina and I are night owls.” She chuckled, as though she’d said something funny, and pushed her purse away. “What’s your name?” Her fingernails absent-mindedly trailed down the lapel of her robe, drawing my attention to the way her nipples raised the thin fabric.</p>
<p>“Jackson,” I mumbled, tearing my eyes away with some difficulty. “I’m Jackson.” She bit her lip and slowly walked around the island toward me. Her robe was coming loose. My heart was pounding in my chest. “Um, is it hot in here?”</p>
<p>I took a step backward and yelped when I bumped into Mina, who was suddenly standing behind me. “Seems fine to me,” she growled in my ear. I tried to move away, but she put a hand on my shoulder, and I felt compelled to stay where I was.</p>
<p>“What do you think, Mina?” Eve purred as she sauntered closer. I caught a glimpse of her thigh as her robe parted. Her skin was darker than Mina’s, a rich copper, gleaming as if she’d recently rubbed herself down with oil.</p>
<p>“He’s not our usual order,” Mina grumbled, pressing her face to my neck and inhaling deeply, as if trying to decide if she liked me based on how I smelled. My pulse was pounding in my ears. I felt sudden relief that I had showered before work. “What happened to Omar?”</p>
<p>“They’re all out. Tonight, we got <em>Jackson</em>,” Eve replied, emphasizing my name. “Seems a waste to send him back.”</p>
<p>“Hrm,” Mina conceded, grabbing a handful of my hair and pulling my head back to expose more of my neck. I shivered as I felt her lips brush against my skin. They were chilled, as though she’d just come in from the cold, though it was a warm night. “You <em>are</em> always telling me to try new things.”</p>
<p>“That’s the spirit.” Eve ran her hands over my chest, and I couldn’t help but gasp as I felt a powerful surge of lust. Confusingly, it was mixed with a sense of dread. She leaned into me, and the heat of her body made me want to tear off our clothes, to feel her skin on mine. Her breasts were soft against my chest, and I felt my cock swelling to life against her hip. She moved as if to kiss me, but at the last second swerved to kiss Mina over my shoulder.</p>
<p>I shivered, sandwiched between these two women, completely overwhelmed. It was all happening so quickly. My mind swirled with a fantasy of falling into bed with them, writhing and groping, thrusting and moaning.</p>
<p>But also, some primal part of my brain was screaming that I was in danger. As badly as I wanted to stay here and let them have their way with me, I was struggling not to turn and run as far and fast as I could.</p>
<p>As if sensing my fear, Mina’s hand tightened on my shoulder as they broke their kiss. The music grew louder, the throbbing bass filling my brain and drowning out any thought of resisting. Eve pulled away, dancing sensuously for the two of us. Her robe fell open, and my cock strained against my jeans at the sight of her body. Large, dark nipples crowned her breasts, firm and erect, begging for my mouth. A trail of fine hair led my eyes downward from her belly button.</p>
<p>“Look at her,” Mina groaned in my ear. “Isn’t she incredible?” I realized that Eve’s dance was affecting Mina the same as me. She released my shoulder and wrapped her arms around me, her pelvis grinding against me from behind.</p>
<p>“You have no idea how lucky you are, Jackson. Men have offered fortunes for the privilege of seeing Eve dance.” Abruptly, she grabbed my cock, nails sharp even through my jeans, and I stifled a cry of alarm. “Men have <em>died</em> for a single night of ecstasy between her thighs.” She eased her grip, teasing her fingers along the length of my shaft. “What will you give up, I wonder?” I shuddered, eyes locked on Eve, barely resisting the urge to hump against her hand like a horny teenager.</p>
<p>“Come dance with me,” Eve said, moving toward the living room, slipping out of her robe as she went. When Mina released me, I trailed after Eve, unaware of anything beyond the sway of her hips, the swell of her bottom. Without thinking, I began to remove my clothes, leaving them in a trail.</p>
<p>We came together in front of the speakers, moving as one. I’ve never been a particularly good dancer, but she guided me. Our bodies entwined, a delicious thrill as the heat of her body met mine. Her soft curves undulated at my touch. My cock throbbed, hard as steel, rubbing against her well-oiled skin. Every touch sent a shiver of pleasure through my body.</p>
<p>Our lips met in a kiss that seemed to be part of her dance. I held her breasts and gasped as she sucked on my bottom lip. Her hands roamed my body, showing me how to move with her. I felt as if she was speaking a language I’d never learned, but as long as she was here, I could almost understand it.</p>
<p>Unable to resist, I lowered my head and wrapped my lips around her nipple. She moaned and rolled her hips, tangling her fingers in my hair, without ever stopping the dance. She guided me to her other breast, gasping as I flicked my tongue. My cock throbbed against her soft skin, and I almost choked with arousal as I kissed my way down her chest and stomach.</p>
<p>I found myself on my knees, worshipping her. She moved in circles around me, and I leaned after her, trying to get closer. I yearned for more, but she stayed just out of reach, driving me wild, teasing me, and stoking my hunger for her.</p>
<p>When she finally stepped closer and allowed me to bury my face between her thighs, I felt a ripple of gratification roll down my spine. She’d judged me worthy and graced me with a taste of paradise. My tongue slipped easily between her lips, slick with arousal. She rolled her hips in time to the music, letting me lick deeper each time. Her taste filled my mouth, the flavor of pure lust, better than anything I’d ever experienced. I moaned happily, body crackling with desire.</p>
<p>I became aware that Mina was standing behind me. She was leaning over me to kiss Eve deeply. Her skin was cold against my back, though perhaps that was just in contrast to the astonishing heat of Eve’s body. I could hear the passion of their kiss as Eve danced against my mouth. I could have stayed there all night, but suddenly Mina grabbed me by the hair and pulled me away with a snarl.</p>
<p>I sputtered in protest as she forced me to turn around, still on my knees. She had also removed her clothes, and her skin was shockingly pale compared to Eve’s. Her breasts were smaller, with pale nipples puckered to hard little points. She spread her thighs, revealing a startlingly pink set of lips that she yanked me towards.</p>
<p>She shivered as my lips met hers, still covered in Eve’s juices, as if using me to transfer her arousal. Even her pussy was cold. I licked deeply, trying to warm her up, to pleasure her as I’d done for Eve.</p>
<p>Mina used me more forcefully, tugging my hair hard, positioning me the way she wanted. She bucked her hips, grinding herself against my face, using me for pleasure. For a moment, doubt filled my head, the haze of lust falling away, replaced by fear. What was I doing?</p>
<p>Then I felt Eve’s hand on my back, and my concerns melted away, replaced by a warm wave of desire. Mina moaned as I sucked on her firm little clit, and slipped a finger inside. Eve’s legs were hot against my back as she leaned forward to wrap her lips around Mina’s nipples.</p>
<p>Mina gasped and tensed as we both focused our efforts on her. She rocked against my face, gripping my hair. “More,” she growled. I slipped another finger inside, her pussy squeezing wetly around them. “More,” she repeated. Eve purred, swaying in time to the music, pulling more of Mina’s small breast into the heat of her mouth. “Oh fuck, more!” She tugged my hair harder until I tapped another finger on her back door.</p>
<p>“More, more, more,” she demanded. I pushed my finger harder against her tightly clenched ass, slowly working it inside. She groaned, and I felt her squeeze my fingers, wetness dripping down my arm. Urgently, I started fucking her in time with Eve’s movements. Mina groaned with each thrust, and Eve moaned along with her, seeming just as aroused.</p>
<p>“That’s it,” she growled as her body tensed. “Keep doing that.” My cock throbbed desperately. I had the taste of two women in my mouth. I wondered if she would let me fuck her if I made her cum. How would it feel to push my cock inside her? I imagined switching back and forth between Mina’s tight pussy and Eve’s soft cunt, savoring the contrast between them.</p>
<p>“Fuck!” Mina snarled. “Fuck! I’m cumming!” With one final thrust against my mouth, her insides clenched so tightly around my fingers it almost hurt. Then she shoved me away, forcefully, shuddering as my fingers slipped out.</p>
<p>I fell hard onto my back, grateful for the thick rug as my head bounced off the floor. Before I had a chance to say anything, Eve kneeled and kissed me deeply, licking Mina’s cum from my lips. I gasped at the absurd rush of lust I felt when her lips touched me. If I didn’t know better, I’d swear her touch was getting me high.</p>
<p>Unable to resist, I wrapped my hand around my shaft and started stroking, moaning into Eve’s mouth. She purred happily and broke our kiss to watch, squeezing her breast and pulling her nipple.</p>
<p>“Please,” I gasped, looking up at her. I wanted so badly to fuck her. She winked and gestured for me to look down.</p>
<p>I did, and a cold wave of panic crashed over me. Crouched over my legs was Mina, but something was different about her. She looked predatory, licking her lips and panting hungrily. I let go of my cock and started trying to scrabble away from her, but bumped into Eve’s legs.</p>
<p>“I warned you,” Mina said with a cruel smile. “What will you give up? No one gets to dance with my wife for free, mortal.” Her teeth suddenly looked very sharp. “And I’m so hungry.”</p>
<p>“Oh fuck!” I practically sobbed.</p>
<p>“Shh,” Eve reassured me, gently caressing my chest. “Be still.” The stimulation made me shiver, and my cock twitched, but my brain was still flooded with terror.</p>
<p>Mina crawled forward, staring hungrily as my cock throbbed in time with my heartbeat. She opened her mouth and moved closer, brushing her lips over the tip and lightly dragging her teeth down the shaft.</p>
<p>I moaned in horror as Eve continued to caress me and whisper soothingly. “Relax,” she breathed. “You made her cum, she’s in a good mood.” Mina’s eyes flashed dangerously. She didn’t look like she was in a good mood. She looked like she wanted to devour me. “I promise, she won’t drain you completely. <em>Will you</em>, Mina?”</p>
<p>Mina hissed, but nodded in grudging agreement. “Fine, my love. For you, I’ll restrain myself.” Then she licked her lips, and I watched in horror as she opened her mouth to reveal two long, pointed teeth, which she promptly plunged into the side of my cock. Blood flowed freely for a moment before she wrapped her lips tightly around me, swallowing hungrily. I cried out, more from shock than pain.</p>
<p>“Not as bad as you thought, is it?” Eve murmured quietly in my ear. I nodded, my fear quickly melting away, replaced by a strange new form of arousal. “Vampire saliva is an incredibly potent aphrodisiac, almost as strong as anything I secrete.” My head was swimming, and I was barely able to understand her words. “Like, everyone knows a succubus will get you off, the best sex you ever had. And it’s true,” she said proudly. “But a vampire can, too. It’s an evolutionary trait…”</p>
<p>She kept talking, but all my attention was on Mina. Her eyes were rolled back in pleasure, slurping greedily as my life flowed into her mouth. I found myself unbelievably turned on by the sight. Rationally, I knew I should be terrified, but instead my cock throbbed and pulsed for her. I gasped and reached down to touch her head, but she snarled at me, eyes flashing red.</p>
<p>“I wouldn’t do that,” Eve giggled. “Here, you can touch me.” She swung her breasts over my head, and I moaned gratefully, squeezing and burying my face between them.</p>
<p>Incredibly, I felt a familiar pressure building. Mina’s lips sucked urgently, tongue lashing against my skin. Eve’s breasts rubbed against my face, her skin hot and slick with sweat that seemed to soak into my pores, making my nerves buzz with arousal. I groaned desperately, knowing that any second my cock would erupt, spraying hot cum over Mina’s face. I wanted to, so badly, but I had a feeling that might go poorly.</p>
<p>“Eve,” I begged into her cleavage. “I need to cum!”</p>
<p>“Mmm, give it to me,” she purred, and quickly crawled down my side to wrap her lips around my swollen head.</p>
<p>“Oh fuck!” I gasped, staring at the incredibly erotic sight of two women sucking my cock. Mina stared up at me through half-lidded eyes, still swallowing hungrily, and Eve met my gaze with an excited look. I felt my cock swell on her tongue as my climax crashed over me. “I’m cumming,” I blurted.</p>
<p>Eve moaned happily as I came hard, flooding her mouth with my cum. Mina, at last, released me and rocked back on her knees. I caught a quick glimpse of a trickle of blood trailing from two punctures before Eve took me deeper, pulling me hungrily into her throat. Mina laughed drunkenly, wiping blood from her lips as she watched Eve eagerly swallowing everything I could give her.</p>
<p>After that, I lay on the floor, gasping for breath and recovering as the two of them got to their feet and danced slowly together, kissing and caressing each other lovingly.</p>
<p>When I finally stood up and pulled my clothes on, Eve walked me to the door.</p>
<p>“Here’s some cash for the delivery and a tip for your service. You’ll probably want to pick up some iron supplements. You’re a bit anemic now, but a good night of sleep will see you right as rain.” She gave me a quick kiss on the cheek and handed me the hot bag, giggling as she closed the door. “You can keep the pizza.”</p>
