  <div class="publication__content short__content">
    <p>“It’s half-price margarita night at Tito’s,” Sandra said, rummaging in her purse as she walked to the front door. “Are you coming?”</p>
<p>“You know it!” Gabby smiled. “I just have to close up, and I’ll meet y’all there.”</p>
<p>All the girls who worked at the clinic went out for drinks every Friday. It made up for the fact that the job was otherwise boring and repetitive, collecting fluid samples from annoying patients to be sent off for lab work. She’d been looking forward to this all week, and since today’s final appointment hadn’t shown up, she was now eagerly watching the clock.</p>
<p>“Well, don’t take too long. You know how Laura gets with some tequila in her. She’ll end up convincing the group to follow her, and we’ll end up at either karaoke or Devil’s Point again.”</p>
<p>“Cast my vote for karaoke,” Gabby laughed. “I’m still finding glitter from last time we went to the strip club.”</p>
<p>Sandra walked out, and before the door closed, a young man in a button-up shirt and slacks came running in.</p>
<p>“I’m here!” He leaned on the counter, winded. “I made it in time for my appointment.”</p>
<p>She frowned at the clock. Technically, the clinic was still open for a few minutes, but any sample would take time to collect and delay her departure. She glanced at the list, to see if he was here for something quick.</p>
<p>“Peter?” She looked up at him to confirm, and caught him peering down the v-neck of her scrub top. He looked away quickly. She mentally cursed, and adjusted herself. This top was too large, and she’d been meaning to replace it.</p>
<p>“Yeah, that’s me!”</p>
<p>“Here to provide a semen sample?”</p>
<p>“Um, yes.” He looked momentarily awkward, but collected himself, trying to play it cool.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry, sir,” she said, standing up and putting on her stern face, “but we just closed. I’m going to have to ask you to reschedule.”</p>
<p>She walked to the door, holding it open for him. His face fell.</p>
<p>“Come on, please?” His eyes darted to her name badge. “Gabby, I work across town. The traffic is killer, and my boss will <em>not</em> let me leave early to make an appointment without burning a vacation day. Do me a favor.”</p>
<p>She hesitated, looking at the clock and dreaming of margaritas.</p>
<p>“I promise, I won’t take long!” He blushed as soon as he said it, realizing he’d just told a pretty young nurse that he was going to cum quickly.</p>
<p>She laughed, despite herself, and he relaxed, sensing he’d won her over.</p>
<p>“Fine, if you’re quick.” She locked the door and walked back around the desk. “Let’s get you checked in.”</p>
<p>A few minutes later, she’d given him a collection cup and escorted him to the private room. He seemed nervous, but most guys were awkward about semen samples.</p>
<p>She puttered around, shutting down the office and getting ready to leave as soon as he was done.</p>
<p>Time passed, and she realized with a sinking feeling that he was going to be one of those guys who took a while. Honestly, she felt bad for them. The “private room” was basically a restroom just a few steps from the front desk. During the day, patients and nurses were constantly walking back and forth past the door. It would be like trying to jerk off in the middle of an office.</p>
<p>He was actually getting more privacy than most, since she was the only one here. But, judging by the time, he was still struggling to get the job done.</p>
<p>She sighed and drummed her fingernails on the desk.</p>
<p>Eventually, she couldn’t take it anymore, and knocked gently on his door.</p>
<p>“Sir? Are you okay in there?”</p>
<p>The lock clicked, and he opened the door enough to poke his head out with a sheepish expression.</p>
<p>“Um, sorry, I’m having a little trouble. Do you have any, like, magazines or anything like that?”</p>
<p>“I’m sorry, we don’t. Could you, um, look at something on your phone?” Now it was her turn to blush. Why did she feel so awkward around this guy? She must be picking up on his vibe.</p>
<p>“I can’t.” He grimaced. “I only have my work phone, and they monitor what we look at.”</p>
<p>“Oh, I see.” She trailed off.</p>
<p>“Okay, sorry about this. I’ll, um, I’ll just make it work.” He looked mortified, and moved to close the door.</p>
<p>“Wait,” she blurted, a bit too loudly. She knew if he closed the door, he would doggedly keep going, no matter how long it took. The other girls would finish their margaritas and move on with their night. She really didn’t want to miss out.</p>
<p>“Do you need any assistance?” She winced, wishing she hadn’t phrased it like that, but unsure how else to say it. Unsure, honestly, of what exactly she was suggesting.</p>
<p>“Assistance?” He looked confused. “With…” He trailed off, glancing downward momentarily.</p>
<p>“Yeah, with your, um, sample.” Before he could react to her shocking suggestion, she started talking quickly. “I know it’s not easy! It’s awkward to come somewhere like this and do something like that. I bet you’re feeling some pressure, since you told me you’d be quick, and now you’re all in your head about it, right?”</p>
<p>He nodded slowly.</p>
<p>“So, I just thought, maybe, I could, um, offer some help.”</p>
<p>Shit. This was the dumbest thing she’d ever done. It sounded like she was propositioning him. He was going to report her to her boss, and she was going to get fired, and probably blacklisted as a sex pest.</p>
<p>“Fuck, I’m sorry,” she stammered, “I don’t know what I was…”</p>
<p>“Yes, please,” he said quietly.</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“Some help would be great.”</p>
<p>They regarded each other for a moment, then he opened the door for her. His pants were undone, and he had one hand still wrapped around his semi-hard cock.</p>
<p>She walked in, painfully aware that she had no plan for what to do next. She leaned against the sink, arms crossed, biting her lower lip as he closed the door. When he turned around, he looked just as uncertain as she felt.</p>
<p>“How can I—”</p>
<p>“What do you—”</p>
<p>They both started talking, and stopped at the same time.</p>
<p>“Sorry,” she said, tucking her hair behind her ear. “This is a little awkward, huh?”</p>
<p>“Yeah.” He leaned against the door. “I’ve, um, never done this before.”</p>
<p>“Neither have I!” She was suddenly worried that he thought she joined every man in his position.</p>
<p>“No, I didn’t mean you had! I just, um…” He trailed off, and they both laughed at the absurdity of the situation. He ran his hand through his hair, and grinned sheepishly at her.</p>
<p>“Alright,” she said, smiling back. “Let’s try this again. How can I help?”</p>
<p>“Um,” He looked briefly panicked at having to suggest something. “Well, I don’t want you to feel like you have to do anything you’re uncomfortable with.” She nodded, waiting for him to continue. “Maybe, um, you could take your top off?”</p>
<p>“Oh!” She immediately relaxed, realizing that she’d been bracing for him to propose something a lot more intimate. “Sure, I can do that.”</p>
<p>She pulled her top off over her head, hung it from a hook on the wall, and leaned back against the sink. Her bra wasn’t anything sexy, but even so, he stared hungrily. She felt goose pimples shiver down her arms.</p>
<p>He shared a nervous look with her, then returned his gaze to her chest and started slowly stroking his cock. It had softened during their conversation, but quickly swelled back to life.</p>
<p>She bit her lip. It was always fascinating to watch a guy get hard. He rubbed his thumb repeatedly over his head, pointing it directly at her. Beneath his slacks, he was wearing basic grey boxers, tugged down just enough to reveal a neatly trimmed thatch of dark hair crowning his shaft.</p>
<p>He met her eyes again, and inhaled shakily, clearly astonished by what was happening. He shifted his grip, cock twitching eagerly. His eyes roamed excitedly over her torso, and she found herself growing warm under his gaze.</p>
<p>She barely knew his name, but here she was undressing and letting him jerk off to the sight of her. Some part of her thought she should feel taken advantage of, but the situation felt refreshingly earnest. There was no pretense here, none of the usual unspoken negotiation that happened around men. No need to dance around the guy’s libido. His desire for her was a simple truth. Naked and growing. She was surprised to find she wanted to encourage it.</p>
<p>Slowly, she ran her hands up her sides and cupped her breasts. He stared, eyes wide, as she caressed and squeezed them through her bra. She felt a rush of excitement as she touched herself the way she imagined he would like to.</p>
<p>When she slipped a hand inside the cup, he let out a gasp and squeezed himself firmly. Her areola puckered, nipple tightening under her palm.</p>
<p>“Can I, um,” he stammered, hardly daring to ask, “can I see?”</p>
<p>Without hesitating, she pulled her bra strap down and scooped her breast from the cup. He shuddered and licked his lips, clearly wishing he was tracing his tongue around her stiff nipple. She reached into the other cup and tried not to imagine pulling his head to her chest. Tried not to notice the growing heat between her thighs.</p>
<p>As his cock swelled and strained in his grasp, a shiver rolled down her spine. It was thrilling, not knowing what would happen next. This wasn’t like when she normally went home with a guy. That was exciting, sure, but you always had some idea of what to expect.</p>
<p>She’d come into this room with no plan, only a vague idea to somehow help him finish faster. She hadn’t really had time to consider what that meant. Despite the long-standing clinic jokes about “platinum service,” it was unheard of for a nurse to assist a patient like this.</p>
<p>And yet, here she was, unhooking her bra and hanging it with her top. She wasn’t dispassionately conducting some medical procedure. This wasn’t clinical. She was intimately involved, actively encouraging his desire. He wasn’t just rubbing out a sample, he was getting off for her. She was going to make him climax. He was going to cum because of her!</p>
<p>She touched herself for him, and thrilled at the lust in his eyes. He was enthralled by the way she grasped and firmly pulled her breasts until her nipples seemed to crackle with electricity. He panted with need as she squeezed them together, hand moving along his shaft with increasing urgency.</p>
<p>She’d never performed for anyone like this before. She found it intoxicating, the way he hungered for her. His cock throbbed in his hand, and she felt an answering flutter inside. She was eager to see him climax. To see his cock twitching and shooting hot, sticky cream…</p>
<p>Suddenly, she realized he wasn’t holding the sample cup. It was sitting on the toilet tank.</p>
<p>“Are you getting close?” She asked, struggling not to sound too eager. “Do you need the cup?”</p>
<p>“Not yet,” he grunted.</p>
<p>“What, um,” she stumbled over her words as she trapped her nipples between her fingers, sending a wave of sensation dancing through her body. “What can I do?”</p>
<p>“Would you—ah!—touch yourself, too?”</p>
<p>A wave of heat washed over her body as she considered his suggestion. Should she? She’d started out caressing her breasts just because it seemed to excite him. It was impossible to deny she was turned on by the situation, but wouldn’t it be crossing the line to join him? To masturbate with him?</p>
<p>On the other hand, she rationalized, everything she was doing was to help a patient in her care. This was perhaps an unorthodox method, but he had a medical need, and she could help. If it happened to address a growing need of her own, well, that was just a side effect.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry, that was too much,” he stammered, face flushed. “I shouldn’t have said that.”</p>
<p>“No, it’s okay,” she reassured him. “I can do that… if it helps.”</p>
<p>“It would help,” he agreed. “Please.”</p>
<p>She slipped a hand into her waistband, savoring his gaze as she slowly reached lower. Parting her legs a bit, she wasn’t surprised to find she was already wet. Bracing herself on the sink with one hand, she closed her eyes and focused on the sensation of her finger slipping between her lips. Gasping, she pressed her palm against her clit.</p>
<p>He grunted, and she opened her eyes to find him watching her intently. It was happening. They were masturbating together! His hand was flying on his cock, and she was curling her finger repeatedly inside. She was touching herself for him. Letting him watch her. The thought made her moan.</p>
<p>She realized with a thrill that he would probably cum faster if he could see what she was doing.</p>
<p>“Would you like me to take these off, too?”</p>
<p>“Oh fuck yes,” he moaned.</p>
<p>Quickly, she pushed her scrub pants and underwear down around her knees, unwilling to take the time to undress fully. She spread her legs, and he groaned as she pushed her finger back inside. Her heart was pounding, watching him watch her. She leaned heavily on the sink, working her finger in a come-hither motion, reaching for that magic spot.</p>
<p>He was panting now, stroking his cock frantically. His head was swollen and smeared with precum. She noticed his slacks had slipped partway down his tensed thighs. His entire body was vibrating with the urgent need to cum, but it still seemed elusive.</p>
<p>What could she do? She added another finger, moaning quietly as she began thrusting into herself, matching his pace. Unbidden, she found herself imagining bending over the sink as he stepped forward to bury himself in her, fucking her fast and hard until he groaned, and she felt him twitching inside.</p>
<p>From the look on his face, he was imagining something similar. Her pussy clenched around her fingers as she imagined how good he would feel inside her…</p>
<p>No! What was she doing? She couldn’t get carried away. She didn’t even know this guy, and they were here for a reason.</p>
<p>The cup! She needed to make him cum in the cup.</p>
<p>“Peter,” she gasped.</p>
<p>He moaned when she said his name.</p>
<p>“You’re ready, aren’t you?”</p>
<p>He nodded eagerly.</p>
<p>“Get the cup, Pete.”</p>
<p>Blinking away whatever fantasy he was engaged in, he leaned over and grabbed the cup, holding it below the tip of his cock.</p>
<p>“Are you gonna cum for me?” She purred.</p>
<p>“I’m close,” he moaned, staring at the fingers plunging in and out of her pussy. “I’m so close.”</p>
<p>“Me too,” she gasped, surprised to realize it. “I want to cum with you.”</p>
<p>“Fuck,” he grunted, face screwed up with effort.</p>
<p>“Are you imagining something?”</p>
<p>“Yes…”</p>
<p>“Tell me.”</p>
<p>“I, um…”</p>
<p>“It’s okay,” she urged. “Tell me!”</p>
<p>“I was thinking about walking over there,” he groaned, “and lifting you up onto that sink…”</p>
<p>“Keep going,” she breathed, feeling the pressure building.</p>
<p>“I would grab your tits…”</p>
<p>“More,” she begged.</p>
<p>“And shove my cock into your wet… fucking… pussy!” He punctuated each word by thrusting forward, fucking his fist.</p>
<p>“Yes!” She squeezed her legs together as her insides begin to clench rapidly around her fingers.</p>
<p>“And cum… inside… Aaah! Oh, fuck! I’m cumming!”</p>
<p>“Oh,” she moaned, as the climax rippled through her body. “Cum for me.”</p>
<p>He stared, wide-eyed at her, rocking back and forth. She watched, fascinated, as his cum shot into the cup. She ground her palm against her clit, the pressure sending diffuse waves of pleasure through her body.</p>
<p>“Mmm,” she moaned happily. “That was so fucking hot.”</p>
<p>“Oh fuck,” he panted, leaning heavily against the door, after milking the last spurt carefully into the cup. “Fuck,” he repeated.</p>
<p>She shivered as she withdrew her fingers, and giggled at the cream around her knuckles.</p>
<p>“Peter, I suppose I should have asked this earlier, but you’re not married or anything, are you?”</p>
<p>“Oh, no, no, no,” he said breathlessly, screwing the lid onto the sample cup. “My lesbian friend asked me to be a donor for her and her partner, but I had to get checked first.”</p>
<p>“Good,” she smiled. “In that case, how do you feel about margaritas?”</p>
