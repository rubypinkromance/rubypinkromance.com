  <p>“Roommate finally asleep. Come to the window and I’ll let you in.”</p>
<p>Lucia bit her lip as she sent the text to Carlos. The rest of the robotics team would flip if they knew she was fooling around with the captain of a rival team. She’d be lying if she said that didn’t make it more fun. Sure, Carlos was an absolute snack, and she’d have been into him regardless… But only seeing each other at meets? Finding excuses to sneak away from their teams? Looking for isolated stairwells where they could have a quickie? That was hot, no doubt about it.</p>
<p>Currently, her entire team was staying in a quad dorm on the MIT campus for a competition. Coach Sam had immediately paired them off into rooms, and she’d ended up with Kara. As a teammate, Kara was great. Smart, passionate, always finding clever solutions and pushing the team to do more. As a roommate? Well, Lucia might have been able to convince Amy or one of the other girls to let her sneak a guy in. But she had a feeling Kara wouldn’t be so understanding, especially if the guy was an opponent.</p>
<p>So when Kara said they should get a good night’s sleep, Lucia agreed. They’d put on their pajamas, turned off the light, and climbed into their beds. Then Lucia pretended to go to sleep while watching Kara like a hawk. Only after what felt like hours did her breathing slow enough that Lucia could text Carlos.</p>
<p>Slowly, she slipped out of her bed and tiptoed to the window, thanking the universe that their room was on the ground floor and had a window that opened fully. Looking across the parking lot, she could see Carlos standing under a light, looking at his phone. He must have already been waiting a while. She grinned. The anticipation was good for him.</p>
<p>Quietly, she slid the window open and waved him over. He was wearing joggers and a tight t-shirt that showed off his broad shoulders. Climbing in was complicated by a large prickly bush under the window, but he managed it without making too much noise.</p>
<p>And then, finally, he was there. He pulled her against him and opened his mouth to say something, but she pressed a finger to his lips and pointed at Kara, mercifully still asleep. He nodded, and she led him to the bed, pulling him down on top of her. No need to talk anyway.</p>
<p>Their hands explored each other’s bodies with increasing urgency. He squeezed her breasts through her tank top and settled his weight between her thighs. She grabbed his ass and pulled him tighter against her. She kissed him aggressively, biting his lower lip and pushing her tongue into his mouth. He responded in kind, and she felt a heat kindle in her core.</p>
<p>He started pulling the hem of her shirt up. She shifted her weight to let him lift it high enough to expose her breasts and tried not to gasp as the heat of his mouth closed around her nipple. She felt it stiffen against his tongue, and he rolled her other nipple between his thumb and forefinger. A lazy wave of heat rolled down her spine to where his weight still rested between her legs.</p>
<p>She thought she saw a movement across the room but was distracted immediately by Carlos getting up on his knees to pull down her shorts. She raised her hips to help and grinned as he discovered she wasn’t wearing any underwear. He parted her legs slowly, reverently. She’d shaved everything this morning, knowing how the sight excited him.</p>
<p>He leaned down to keep sucking on her nipple as his hand slid up her thigh. She bit her lip as his warm fingers teased her folds, gently at first, but with increasing enthusiasm. She let him tease a fingertip between her lips but gently pushed his hand away as he moved toward her clit. He meant well, but he had a tendency to be too aggressive, treating her most sensitive spot like it was a miniature cock.</p>
<p>She appreciated the effort, but what really got her wet was sucking his cock. Carlos was blessed. His shaft was a lovely shade of brown, and just on the edge of too large for her. He kept clean and trimmed, and she loved seeing how deep she could swallow him.</p>
<p>She got up onto her hands and knees, and he was already tugging down his pants. He also wasn’t wearing underwear, and she eagerly took his cock into her mouth, where it stiffened quickly. He bit his knuckle and tried not to make any noise as she let her tongue dance against his head.</p>
<p>She grinned when she felt him gently push his hips forward, and let him go deeper. When he bumped against the back of her mouth, she tried to relax her throat. She loved swallowing him this way.</p>
<p>After a moment, she felt his hand cradling the back of her head and he started to move his hips more insistently. Trying not to gag, she followed his lead, allowing him to start slowly fucking her mouth as a surge of desire washed over her. Gradually, his pace quickened as he got more excited, thrusting deeper each time until her forehead was resting against his taut stomach. Her eyes watered, and she felt her throat tighten, which made his breath catch as he tried not to cry out.</p>
<p>Finally, sputtering and nearly choking, she had to pull away. Carlos shuddered, trying to quietly catch his breath. Still kneeling, his cock jutted towards her, glistening wet and twitching. Wiping her mouth and grinning, she turned around and dropped onto her elbows, shaking her upturned ass at him. She’d had plans for a long, slow, quiet night of lovemaking, but right now all she wanted was him behind her, burying his cock in her now-dripping pussy.</p>
<p>She buried her face in the pillow to avoid making a sound as he rubbed his head between her lips and pushed just a little way inward. She felt him grip her hips and shivered, knowing he was about to start fucking her. They both paused, savoring the anticipation. She had no idea how they would keep from making any noise that would wake Kara.</p>
<p>Glancing in her roommate’s direction, Lucia was shocked to make eye contact. Just for a fraction of a second, until Kara quickly shut her eyes. It was over so quickly, she wondered if she’d imagined it. Even so, it caused a complicated mix of emotions to wash over her. Surprise. Embarrassment. Confusion. Worry.</p>
<p>But mostly? Lust. Because she could have sworn that Kara’s eyes were filled with arousal.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Carlos thrust forward, burying himself deep inside her. She gasped, and for a moment, all thoughts were driven from her mind. She had to bite the pillow to keep from crying out. God, she loved this. Knowing she’d turned him on this much, gotten him this hard, and now he was <em>fucking</em> her.</p>
<p>Was Kara really watching? How long had she been watching? Had she been awake the whole time? Or had she woken up to the wet sounds of her sucking Carlos’ cock? Why hadn’t she said anything? Was she getting off right now? Lucia gasped at the idea of Kara with her hand in her underwear, trying just as hard as they were to be quiet.</p>
<p>Carlos reached down between her thighs to rub her clit. Normally she would have stopped him, but now she wondered if it would turn Kara on to see it. She risked another quick peek and once again made eye contact for a heartbeat before Kara shut her eyes, still pretending to sleep. There was no longer any doubt. Kara was awake, watching, and into it.</p>
<p>Involuntarily (mostly), Lucia moaned as Carlos removed his hand from between her thighs and grabbed a handful of her hair instead. He pulled firmly backward, forcing her up off her elbows, arching her back until she had to put her hands on the headboard. He was fucking her hard now, slamming against her enough to make her tits bounce. Tension was building deep in her core.</p>
<p>Another glance, another brief moment of eye contact. Lucia was almost certain she could see movement below the covers. Kara <em>must</em> be masturbating as she watched them fuck. Carlos pulled her hair tighter and she whimpered, gripping the headboard tightly. Did Kara like girls? Was she staring at her tits or his cock? Maybe both? Was she thrusting fingers into her pussy, matching their pace, imagining how it would feel if Carlos was fucking her?</p>
<p>Lucia was gasping from the excitement of the situation. Finally, she looked directly at Kara. Not a glance, but prolonged contact. She wanted to see Kara watching. No more pretending to be asleep. Kara’s eyes showed a moment of shock, but this time she didn’t close them or look away. The movement under the covers seemed to quicken. Her pussy clenched with excitement. Carlos was fucking her while Kara watched. She was right on the edge, and Kara was getting off watching her!</p>
<p>Kara mouthed the word “cum,” and Lucia didn’t know if that meant Kara was cumming, or she knew Lucia was about to, or if she was giving an order. Regardless, all her muscles contracted and she cried out as a gush of warm fluid ran down her thighs. Carlos released his grip on her hair, allowing her to collapse onto the pillow as he held her hips, keeping his cock deep inside through her orgasm.</p>
<p>When her vision cleared, Kara was still staring right at her. She looked impressed, embarrassed, and jealous all at the same time. A sense of relaxed bliss came over Lucia as she kept looking at Kara. She knew the two of them would never understand each other more clearly than they did at this moment. They both knew, without any need to speak, that Kara would close her eyes and continue pretending to sleep while Lucia finished Carlos off and sent him back the way he came. They would never speak about this, but it would be a secret they shared, communicated only by a sly smile now and then.</p>
<p>And so Lucia wasn’t sure who was more surprised when, instead of all that, she found herself saying aloud, “Do you like watching Carlos fuck me, Kara?”</p>
<p>“Hey, uh, what?” Carlos stammered, completely oblivious to all that had happened.</p>
<p>“Fuck!” Kara squeaked and tried to hide her face under the covers.</p>
<p>Lucia climbed off the bed, leaving Carlos behind as she crossed the room. Gently, she pulled the covers from Kara’s face. Her eyes were wide with shock and alarm.</p>
<p>“Hey, hey, don’t worry,” Lucia reassured, sitting on the edge of the bed and touching Kara’s cheek. “It’s okay, You like to watch, I get it. Did you like seeing me go down on him?”</p>
<p>Kara seemed hesitant to answer, but her eyes said yes.</p>
<p>“Yeah, that was sexy, huh?” Lucia bit her lip and let her fingertips slowly wander down Kara’s neckline. “What about when he got behind me?”</p>
<p>Still unsure how to react, Kara gave a tiny nod.</p>
<p>“Mmmm… Yeah, I bet that looked hot. Did you see the way he pulled my hair? How he made my tits bounce ‘cause he was fucking me so hard?”</p>
<p>Kara nodded and shivered as Lucia leaned in close to whisper in her ear.</p>
<p>“I’m glad you were watching, it got me off. Do you want to see how wet it made me?”</p>
<p>“Yeah…” Kara responded quietly. Then, with more determination: “I do.”</p>
<p>Lucia smiled encouragingly as she stood up. Kara watched with aroused curiosity as Lucia slipped a finger between her lips, then showed her the lubrication coating it. Unconsciously, Kara licked her lips.</p>
<p>“Do you want to see closer?”</p>
<p>Eyes wide, Kara nodded.</p>
<p>“Here, come this way.” Lucia gently touched Kara’s shoulder, encouraging her to turn so she was laying sideways with her head over the edge of the mattress. As she did, the covers pulled away, revealing a deep v-neck and pink bikini briefs. She seemed unsure of what to do with her hands, timidly adjusting the hem of her shirt.</p>
<p>Lucia moved to straddle Kara’s head. “Look at me, Kara,” she purred. She could feel Kara’s hot breath on her thighs. “Does it turn you on to see my pussy like this?” Kara nodded and squirmed, squeezing her thighs together.</p>
<p>“You told me to cum, right? Well, I did,” Lucia reached down and spread her lips, letting Kara see how creamy she was. “Do you want to taste it?”</p>
<p>“Yes,” Kara gasped. Lucia lowered herself to slide her wet lips over Kara’s. She purred as her roommate’s tongue moved against her, tracing her folds and dipping inside. She rocked against her mouth and chin. Kara’s hands moved from fidgeting with her shirt to grabbing Lucia’s ass.</p>
<p>“It got me so hot to see you watching me… Were you touching yourself?” In answer, Kara spread her legs, letting Lucia see the wet spot on the gusset of her panties.</p>
<p>“Fuck, that’s hot… Can I touch you, Kara?” She felt a nod between her thighs and leaned forward, planting her hands on either side of the brunette’s hips. Shifting her weight to one arm, she slipped her free hand into Kara’s underwear. Her fingers brushed past a neatly trimmed patch of hair to feel wet lips.</p>
<p>“Ooh, <em>chica</em>, you’re dripping!” Kara nodded enthusiastically as Lucia easily slipped a finger in. As she hooked upward, the brunette let out a moan of pleasure. That sent surprising vibrations through Lucia’s pussy, and she gasped and pushed deeper.</p>
<p>“Oh fuck, Kara, lick my clit, please,” Lucia begged, as she felt her tongue push deeper between her lips. “How… ah! How many fingers did you have inside? One?” The head between her thighs shook and then moaned as Lucia added a second finger. “Two?” Urgent nodding. Lucia started fucking her with two fingers, her palm pressing against Kara’s clit.</p>
<p>“When did you start touching yourself? Did you wait until he got behind me?” Kara shook her head again and traced tight little circles around her clit. “Ooooh, that feels good. Was it when I was sucking his cock?” Nodding. “Yeah, he’s got a really nice <em>cock</em>.” Every time she said it, Kara’s pussy clenched. “Sucking his <em>cock</em> always gets me wet.” She hooked her fingers, feeling for Kara’s g-spot, and savored the way the brunette spread her thighs, begging for more.</p>
<p>“Do you want to see it?” Lucia felt Kara’s cunt clench around her fingers. “Heh, I’ll take that as a yes.” She looked behind her and saw Carlos sitting on the edge of her bed, lazily stoking himself as he watched the two of them.</p>
<p>“Come over here, babe, she wants to see you up close.” Dutifully, Carlos walked closer, standing directly behind her. She couldn’t see, but she knew Kara must be distracted by the sight. Her tongue slowed, and her pussy began squeezing excitedly around Lucia’s fingers. Fuck, she must be right on the edge, Lucia realized.</p>
<p>Somewhat reluctantly, Lucia raised herself away from Kara’s mouth. She looked down between her thighs and saw her roommate gasping with pleasure. Her chin was covered in Lucia’s wetness. Her eyes were locked on Carlos’ long brown shaft. Her body was tense, ready to cum any second.</p>
<p>“Do you want to suck his <em>cock</em>?”</p>
<p>“Oh my god, yes,” Kara groaned, panting as Lucia kept her palm pressed against her clit and Carlos rubbed his cock right next to her face. Her pussy was clenching rapidly. There was no denying her imminent orgasm.</p>
<p>“Do it, babe,” Lucia blurted, as Kara parted her lips. “She’s about to cum!” Carlos wrapped his hands around the back of her head, supporting her neck as she eagerly sucked half his length into her mouth.</p>
<p>“Fuck,” Carlos grunted, “You’re so hot! Can I go deeper?” Kara moaned in agreement and reached out with both hands to grab his ass, pulling him closer.</p>
<p>“Yeah, babe, she wants to swallow you,” Lucia exclaimed. Kara groaned and choked as he pushed forward, but at the same time, her body shook with wave after wave of pleasure. Lucia felt a gush of hot fluid around her fingers as Kara’s thighs suddenly squeezed shut around her hand.</p>
<p>“Shit, she’s cumming so hard right now! She loves having her mouth stuffed with your cock.”</p>
<p>“Ugh, fuck! Her throat is so tight, I’m gonna cum too,” Carlos exclaimed.</p>
<p>“No!” Lucia ordered, “That’s mine, put your cock back in my cunt.” Kara coughed and groaned deliriously as both Carlos’ cock and Lucia’s fingers pulled out abruptly. “UGH, fuck yeah,” Lucia groaned as he slipped effortlessly back into her. “Fuck me hard, I want her to watch as you shoot that load in my pussy.”</p>
<p>Carlos wasted no time, grabbing Lucia’s hips and roughly fucking her. She dropped back onto her elbows, pressing her face against Kara’s stomach, grunting with each thrust. She felt Kara’s hands grip her cheeks, spreading them for a better view.</p>
<p>Carlos let out a strangled cry of triumph as he thrust deep and held there, his cock twitching inside her as he came hard. After a moment, he pulled out and staggered back, collapsing on the other bed.</p>
<p>Moaning happily, Lucia pushed herself upright. She swayed gently in place, catching her breath, and still straddling Kara’s head. The brunette’s shirt was twisted to one side, the v-neck revealing the sex flush across her chest. Her visibly wet panties were slid partway down her hip.</p>
<p>“Kara,” Lucia giggled, as she felt thick, hot liquid begin to slip from her lips. “See how full of cum I am?” Kara looked up, eyes still wide with arousal as Carlos’s cum dripped across her chin and cheek.</p>
<p>“<em>Dios mío, chica!</em>” Laughing deliriously with excitement, Lucia took her hand and pulled her up into an embrace. Kara hugged her back, laughing as Lucia stepped back and looked into her eyes.</p>
<p>“That was… unexpected?” Kara said uncertainly.</p>
<p>“Yeah, but good, right?” Lucia beamed. “Can I kiss you?”</p>
<p>“Um, yeah, please,” Kara said, and then Lucia pressed against her. The kiss was long and heated. Lucia savored the mingled taste of both her and Carlos’ cum on Kara’s lips. She felt a heat growing in her core again.</p>
<p>Breaking the kiss, Lucia shot a quick glance at Carlos. Unsurprisingly, the sight of the two of them kissing had reignited the spark of desire in his eyes.</p>
<p>“You know, Kara,” she whispered conspiratorially, “I can get him hard again. Maybe… we could trade places this time? I could get under you and you can finger me while I watch him fuck you?”</p>
<p>But Kara looked hesitant.</p>
<p>“Oh, don’t worry, I won’t let him cum inside you! He can cum in my mouth. I just think it’d be hot to watch you get fucked… That’s not it, is it?”</p>
<p>Kara bit her lip and stepped back, pulling her underwear up and adjusting her shirt.</p>
<p>“No, um, I mean, I had a lot of fun. Like, a surprising amount of fun?” The words came tumbling out of her. “I didn’t even know I liked girls. I came here with a crush on Ian, and he’s been flirting with Amy the whole time, and then I saw you two, and it got me so turned on, and then, you know, this all happened, and like… I’m glad? But also I think I need to go like get some air…”</p>
<p>“Hey, hey, that’s fine.” Lucia smiled and reached out and squeezed her hand. “I get it, this all happened really fast. Let me know if you ever want to talk about it, okay?”</p>
<p>“Yeah,” Kara nodded, “I’d like that.”</p>
<p>“Cool… Um, are you okay if I still fool around with Carlos for a bit?”</p>
<p>“Oh, yeah, of course, I mean, I’m not trying to stop you guys, I just need to slow down a bit?” Kara picked up her phone and shorts and moved to the door. “Just text me when you’re done, okay?”</p>
<p>The door closed with a quiet click and they heard her footsteps pad down the hall. A long moment passed.</p>
<p>“Is she gonna be okay?” Carlos asked.</p>
<p>Lucia felt a warm glow in her chest. Abruptly she turned, pushed him down on the bed, and lay down beside him. “You’re sweet.” She gave him a kiss and threw a leg over him. “She’s fine, she just needed some air.”</p>
<p>“Oh good,” he nodded, “I was worried we scared her off.”</p>
<p>“Worried you scared her off with your <em>huge cock</em>?” Lucia laughed.</p>
<p>“Hey, I can’t help how big I am.” He grinned, and she felt him twitch under her thigh.</p>
<p>“You better help <em>me</em> with how big you are,” Lucia growled playfully, reaching down to caress his quickly stiffening shaft. “I’ve been looking forward to this for weeks, and I need you to make me cum again before I kick your ass out.”</p>
<p>“Mmmmmm, will you go down on me for a minute?”</p>
<p>“Of course,” she purred, scooting down and taking him in her mouth. He tasted of cum, and before long he was pressed against the back of her mouth, and she came up gasping.</p>
<p>“Do you …ah!” Carlos gasped as she straddled him, slipping his cock back inside her. “Oh, that feels good… You don’t think she’ll tell the coaches about us, do you?”</p>
<p>“Nah,” Lucia purred, rolling her hips and savoring the way he filled her. “I think she was just a little overwhelmed by how into it she was and how fast things went. I bet…ah… ah…” Lucia arched her back, losing her words for a moment. “Yeah, like that babe… Um, she’s just realized some new things about herself. She’ll be fine.” She leaned forward, putting her hands on the headboard and her tits in his face. “Now stop talking about Kara and suck on my nipples.”</p>
<p>Lucia gasped as his lips closed around her breast. She ground her pelvis against him, savoring the pressure on her clit and the way his cock filled her. Everything was sensitive and lights were dancing on the edge of her vision again. Her body felt like it was crackling with electricity. Having Carlos under her felt like the most natural thing in the world, and she never wanted to get off. She wondered if she could stay at this level all night, just riding this wave of arousal…</p>
<p>“Mmmm! Oh, fuck,” Carlos groaned, his face buried in her chest.</p>
<p>“Yeah, baby, keep going, you’re so fucking hot,” she breathed. He responded by switching to her other nipple and reaching back to squeeze her ass. She squealed as he thrust his hips, lifting her off the bed and somehow reaching deeper inside her.</p>
<p>Quickly, they found their groove, moving as one, Lucia rocking forward and back as he gripped her tightly, pulling her against him as he pushed up. He released her nipple with a loud wet smack and dropped his head onto the pillow. His eyes locked with hers, and she saw nothing but his desire.</p>
<p>“Ah! Lucia! Please!” She felt his body stiffen, and his cock swell. He was going to cum again. She was going to make him cum again. The thought was enough to push her over the edge. She dropped down, burying her face in his neck, and squeezing him between her thighs. Her climax radiated from her core, from his cock, in waves of pleasure.</p>
<p>“Yes, Carlos, Carlos! Do it, please, cum for me!” She squeezed her eyes shut and bit his shoulder, flashes of orange and yellow as her orgasm rolled on and on. He wrapped his arms around her and held her tightly as his entire body rocked. She felt a spreading heat as his cock throbbed in her clenching pussy.</p>
<p>For several minutes, they were speechless. She breathed against his neck and savored the lingering aftershocks. Eventually, his cock softened enough to slip out of her with a squelching sound that made them both laugh.</p>
<p>He pulled her into a long, lazy kiss before letting his arms drop limply to his sides.</p>
<p>“Fuck me, that was amazing.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, it was.”</p>
<p>“You think Kara’s coming back soon?” She could feel him grinning as he asked, and playfully smacked him.</p>

<p>“Alright, but stay here with me awhile longer.” She sighed happily and nuzzled against him as he lazily caressed her back.</p>
