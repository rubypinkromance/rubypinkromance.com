  <div class="publication__content short__content">
    <p>“Head to the bathroom on your side. Take off your clothes, blindfold yourself, and wait for me in the shower. I’ll be there soon. Be ready for me! 💋”</p>
<p>Amy grinned as she texted Ian. He was cute enough, though a bit vanilla for her taste. She’d been teasing him all day, and he was sure to jump at the chance to hook up with her. The coaches had said it was time for bed more than an hour ago, and old people went to sleep early, so it had to be safe to sneak across by now.</p>
<p>She walked to the door and glanced at her roommate. She was on her phone too, probably texting her girlfriend in the room next door. The coaches had been quick to separate them when assigning rooms.</p>
<p>“Bonnie, I’m going to the bathroom.”</p>
<p>“Uh-huh,” she responded, completely uninterested.</p>
<p>Amy stepped out, closed the door, and paused. The building they were in had a communal kitchen in the middle, with hallways on either side leading to the bedrooms and bathrooms. Ian and Wally were in a room down the other hallway, and she just had to walk across to the bathroom on that side. But adjoining the kitchen was a common room, and she could hear the TV playing. Shit, were the coaches still awake? Well, whatever. She was just going to the bathroom, after all. They couldn’t possibly object to that.</p>
<p>She confidently strolled down the hall and into the kitchen, intending to walk straight through to the other hallway without even looking towards the couches where the coaches were sitting.</p>
<p>“What’s up, Amy?” Coach Sam immediately turned to face her. Her arms were crossed, and the impatient expression on her face made Amy hesitate for a moment.</p>
<p>“I’m, uh,” she cleared her throat and tried to sound nonchalant. “I’m just going to the bathroom.”</p>
<p>“Uh-huh.” Coach Sam looked down the opposite hall like she somehow knew Ian was waiting there. “Any reason you can’t use the one by your room?”</p>
<p>“Uh…” Amy’s mind blanked as she tried to think of a reason. “I left my… hairbrush in the other bathroom?”</p>
<p>“Well, I’m pretty sure someone’s in there right now. I think your hairbrush can wait for morning.”</p>
<p>“Oh, uh… sure, that makes sense.” Amy stalled, struggling to think of another reason, but came up with nothing. After a moment, she turned around, inwardly seething, and walked back down her hall to the bathroom on her side.</p>
<p>Well, if she couldn’t get to Ian, he’d just have to come to her.</p>
<p>“Stupid Coach Sam saw me and sent me to the other bathroom. Sneak over here and join me. 😛🍌”</p>
<p>There, now it was Ian’s problem. She was confident he was motivated enough to find a way past the coaches.</p>
<p>Amy turned her attention to the mirror. Her bleached blonde hair was pulled back into a ponytail. There were clear bikini tan lines on her shoulders. She was wearing a green cami over a leopard-print bra. She took a moment to adjust her breasts and nodded approvingly at her cleavage.</p>
<p>Deciding that it would be sexier to already be partly undressed when Ian walked in, she removed her shorts and top. For a moment, she frowned at her reflection. The black panties with pink trim were cute, but it annoyed her that they didn’t match her bra. Whatever, it was fine. A guy like Ian didn’t need her A-game. He’d be grateful she tapped him at all.</p>
<p>Speaking of, where was he? It had been like ten minutes already.</p>
<p>“Come on, I’m ready for you! 🍆🌮💦”</p>
<p>Confident in her appearance, she lounged against the wall and spent a while going through her Insta. Lots of likes on her photo from the beach. After liking all her friend’s posts, she blocked a couple of pests.</p>
<p>Leaving her phone on the counter with her clothes, Amy wandered into the shower. There was a bench that looked promising if they pulled it away from the wall. She could imagine pushing him back until he was laying full-length, and then straddling him…</p>
<p>If he ever gets here. Scowling at the door, she picked up her phone again and texted him.</p>
<p>“What’s taking so long? 🤨”</p>
<p>She tried to kill a few minutes playing a game on her phone, but her annoyance at Coach Sam made her mess up. Ugh, what was her problem? The coaches were treating them all like they were kids, sneaking around after curfew. Sure, she actually <em>was</em> sneaking around, but they didn’t <em>know</em> that, and it felt condescending to be treated this way.</p>
<p>“Where the fuck are you? 😖”</p>
<p>Exhaling her frustration, Amy turned back to the mirror and tried on some seductive poses. She arched her back and stuck her butt out. She squeezed her breasts together. But her irritation at being kept waiting was growing by the minute.</p>
<p>“NOT a good idea to keep me waiting. 😤”</p>
<p>If he’d been caught by the coaches, he could have at least texted her. It’d been like a half hour, that was plenty of time, even if he’d had to crawl through the kitchen on his hands and knees to stay out of sight.</p>
<p>Slowly, it dawned on her that she’d been stood up. What the actual fuck! This boy had no idea how lucky he was that she’d taken even a moment of interest in him.</p>
<p>“Your loss! 🤬”</p>
<p>Fuming, Amy got dressed and left the bathroom. She was about to go back to her room when she realized that the TV was much quieter than before. Maybe the coaches were asleep now? She decided to try to sneak across again and go to Ian’s room to tell him off and remind him what he’d missed out on by not even trying to reach her.</p>
<p>Creeping slowly to the end of the hallway, she peeked into the common room. A late-night show was playing. Coach Jake was alone on the couch. It looked like he’d fallen asleep, head lolled back, and slouched low under a blanket.</p>
<p>Where was Coach Sam? Nervously, she looked around but didn’t see anything. Then she noticed the blanket move, and he quietly moaned.</p>
<p>Holy shit! Jake wasn’t asleep, and that must be Sam under the blanket blowing him! Amy bit her knuckle to keep from squealing. Her shock quickly gave way to outrage. Of course, they were hypocrites. They were only stopping <em>her</em> from hooking up because it got in the way of <em>their</em> action!</p>
<p>As quickly as she dared, she crept through the dark kitchen, keeping an eye on the couch and prepared to drop to the floor if they moved. Thankfully, they were completely distracted and she made it across without being noticed.</p>
<p>Filled with equal parts triumph and annoyance, she opened Ian’s door without knocking and slipped inside, shutting it quietly behind her. The room was only dimly lit by moonlight, and it took her eyes a moment to adjust. When they did, she realized with confusion that only one bed was occupied. Ian’s best friend Wally was asleep on his back and snoring softly.</p>
<p>Where the fuck was Ian? Was he still in the bathroom? No, he would have seen all her texts. There was only one possible explanation. Not only had he blown her off, but he’d done it to fuck some other girl! She practically saw red at the idea. Not that she cared if he slept with anyone else, of course. This was always going to be a one-time thing. But the idea that he’d choose someone else over a chance with her? Outrageous. Well, she’d show him.</p>
<p>Without hesitation, she walked over to Wally’s bed, lifted the covers, and climbed on top of him. He was sleeping in only boxers, and his skin was hot to the touch.</p>
<p>“Hey, whassat?” Wally murmured. He blinked at her in confusion, trying to focus on her face. “Amy?”</p>
<p>“Shhh, yeah it’s me.” She ran her hands over his shoulders and down his chest.</p>
<p>“What’s going on? I thought you and Ian were hooking up?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, well, I’m hooking up with you instead.”</p>
<p>“Huh?” He shook his head and adjusted his position under her. “No, no, I can’t do that.”</p>
<p>“Why not?” As she asked, she reached down and felt the shape of his cock through his boxers.</p>
<p>“Ian’s my bro!” He tried to pull her hand away. “You don’t hook up with a chick your bro likes.”</p>
<p>“Are you being serious right now?” She pushed her hand back down and started rubbing him, noting that despite his protests, he was starting to get hard.</p>
<p>“Hey, no, stop that!” He got up on one elbow and tried to push her away. “Why are you here? Where’s Ian?”</p>
<p>“Ugh, fine!” She sat up, still straddling him, but no longer groping him. “Your <em>bro</em> stood me up, alright?”</p>
<p>“He did?” Wally looked confused. “So you’re here to, what, fuck me to get back at him?”</p>
<p>“Yes,” Amy responded defiantly.</p>
<p>“Oh, cool,” a slow grin replaced the confusion on his face. “Why didn’t you say so?”</p>
<p>“What? Seriously?”</p>
<p>“Yeah! If he blew you off, then I’m in the clear!”</p>
<p>“You’re saying he’d be fine with me fucking you instead of him?”</p>
<p>“Oh, no way, it’ll piss him off. But it’s not a violation of the bro code, you know?”</p>
<p>“That’s idiotic. You’re both idiots.”</p>
<p>Wally just shrugged, and she felt his cock twitch under her.</p>
<p>“Fine. Whatever.” She peeled off her top and unhooked her bra, to his obvious delight.</p>
<p>“Excellent!” Wally grinned and sat up to bury his face in her chest.</p>
<p>Despite her annoyance with the situation, she soon found herself squirming in his lap as his tongue circled her nipples and his cock grew until it was pressing against her. Slowly, her irritation melted away, replaced by a growing heat wherever his body touched hers. She gasped, rolling her hips to grind more firmly against him as he squeezed her breasts.</p>
<p>“Get undressed,” she breathed in his ear. She climbed off and slid her shorts down her hips with exaggerated slowness. She could feel his eyes on her ass as she bent over in front of him, stepping out of her panties with unnecessarily exaggerated movements.</p>
<p>When she turned around, he had kicked the blanket and his boxers away. He was sitting expectantly on the edge of the bed, his cock pointing proudly toward the ceiling. He had a big cheesy grin on his face. It was dumb, but his obvious gratitude made her feel better. <em>This</em> was how guys were supposed to react to her attention.</p>
<p>She lowered herself to her knees and wrapped her lips around his cock. He groaned and immediately grabbed her ponytail, using it like a handle to push her deeper. Offended, she swatted his hand away. She didn’t need any “help.”</p>
<p>Although giving a blowjob didn’t do much for her, she took a certain amount of pride in knowing how to give a good one. Her tongue flicked against the tip, and her lips slipped wetly over the rim of his head. One hand moved along his shaft with growing intensity, while the other teased the sensitive skin behind his scrotum. Before long he was gasping and moaning, his legs tense on either side of her.</p>
<p>Finally, she let him go with a wet smack. He collapsed back on the bed, one arm over his eyes, trying to catch his breath.</p>
<p>“Damn, Amy, you’re a good cocksucker.”</p>
<p>“Thank you,” she replied, wiping her mouth and sitting on the edge of the bed next to him. “Now it’s your turn.”</p>
<p>“Oh, nah, I don’t like doing that,” he responded without even looking at her.</p>
<p>Annoyed, she flicked his cock. He jumped up, looking shocked.</p>
<p>“What, like I love the taste of dick?” She glared at him as he shrugged. “Ugh, fine, whatever, you’re probably terrible at it anyway. Give me a second to get ready.”</p>
<p>Amy laid down on his bed, adjusting his pillow and getting comfortable. She took a few deep breaths, trying to let the annoyance fade away, and focused on the ember of arousal in her core. Licking her lips, she cupped her breasts. Her nipples were still sensitive from Wally’s tongue. Slowly, she let one hand slide down her stomach and over her hip, spreading her legs. Her finger eased between her lips, finding the wetness hidden inside. Sighing, she dipped in and spread her lubrication over her lips.</p>
<p>Wally made an approving sound, and she glanced over to see him standing by the bed, eagerly stroking his cock at her. Biting her lip, she gestured for him to join her. He climbed onto the bed, kneeling between her legs, still masturbating, as he watched her tease her clit. He inched forward until his thighs pressed against hers. She felt the heat of his body, his hand brushing against hers as they both touched themselves with increasing urgency.</p>
<p>“Fuck, that’s hot,” he groaned. “I’ve never watched a girl get off before.”</p>
<p>“I want you in me, now,” she gasped.</p>
<p>Amy grabbed his cock and positioned him against her opening. He dropped onto his elbows and settled his weight between her thighs. They both moaned as he slipped inside. Slowly, he started moving his hips, gently and lazily fucking her. She closed her eyes to focus on the sensation, then sputtered as he tried to stick his tongue in her mouth.</p>
<p>“Sorry,” he said sheepishly.</p>
<p>“No, no, I just wasn’t expecting that,” she tried to explain. “Sorry, but I’m not here for kissing. That’s not what I’m looking for.”</p>
<p>“Uh, yeah, yeah, okay.” He looked confused.</p>
<p>“I don’t want sweet and slow and rainbows and unicorns right now, okay? I want you to <em>fuck</em> me. Yeah? Can you do that, Wally?”</p>
<p>When she said his name, she felt his cock throb inside her, and then he started moving against her.</p>
<p>“Yes! That’s it, I want—Uh!—I want to feel your—Ah!—cock…”</p>
<p>He buried his face against her neck, pulled almost all the way out, and slammed his weight back onto her in a way that caused sparks at the edge of her vision.</p>
<p>“Oh yeah, like that, fuck me like that—Ah!—fuck me hard—Ah! Ah!—harder!”</p>
<p>Every time she spoke, he thrust harder into her.</p>
<p>“Ah! Yeah, Wally, fuck—Oh! God!—Your dick is so hard in my pussy — Ah Ah AH!—fuck me!”</p>
<p>Wally began thrusting away with abandon. He was grunting in her ear. She wrapped her legs around him and clawed at his back.</p>
<p>“Oh god! Oh god! Oh god! Keep fucking me like that!”</p>
<p>A stream of filthy porn nonsense spilled from her lips. Each statement made him grunt and thrust, rutting away like an animal.</p>
<p>“Jesus, yes, fuck, that’s it, fuck, fuck, fuck, Wally, god your cock is going so deep, you’re filling me up, my cunt is so wet!”</p>
<p>This was everything she wanted. She felt the pressure building in her core. She heard the ocean roaring in her ears and her vision began to blur, replaced by auras of color.</p>
<p>Then, abruptly, he rolled off her. She groaned at the sudden loss of his cock and the weight of his body. He was panting hard, and she was vaguely aware that he was apologizing, saying he was close but needed a minute to rest his arms.</p>
<p>“Shut up, just lie there,” she murmured as she climbed on top of him, determined to reclaim her orgasm. “Don’t do anything, just let me ride you until I cum.”</p>
<p>His cock slid back in like it belonged to her. This angle was different, but maybe better. She rolled her hips, feeling where the pressure hit. Quickly, she found a groove, rocking back and forth on top of him. Her hands were on his chest, fingernails digging into his skin.</p>
<p>She opened her eyes and saw him looking up at her with awe and lust. He watched her tits bounce in time with her movements and she felt him swelling. Fuck! He was going to cum before she could finish.</p>
<p>“No, stop it,” she groaned, shoving her hand over his face to cover his eyes. “Let me cum first, I’m so close.”</p>
<p>He moaned, and she pushed her fingers into his mouth. He sucked, hard, and she felt her pussy starting to clench. She leaned forward to put a bit more pressure on her clit and suddenly cried out as the pressure released.</p>
<p>Wave after wave of sensation radiated out from her pussy and all she could see were fireworks. She rocked back and forth, letting it roll through her until she felt his cock swelling again.</p>
<p>“Amy!” He choked around her fingers.</p>
<p>She jumped off him and quickly wrapped her hands around his cock, covered in her creamy juices. His entire body went rigid as she urgently stroked his shaft. Hot sticky cum spilled over her fingers, spurting onto his stomach. He grunted with each throb of his cock, thrusting into her hands over and over.</p>
<p>Eventually, it passed, and she collapsed down on his side, both of them breathing heavily. Her arm was draped over his body, still idly playing with his cum as his cock softened. Her other hand moved between her thighs, palm pressed against her clit, which felt too sensitive to leave uncovered.</p>
<p>A long time passed as their heartbeats slowed and their breathing regulated. Finally, he took a deep breath and wrapped his arm around her, pulling her in close with her head on his shoulder.</p>
<p>“Fuck me, that was hot. Let me know if there’s anyone else you want to get back at.”</p>
<p>Amy laughed and half-heartedly swatted him.</p>
<p>“I still think this bro code of yours is idiotic.”</p>
<p>“You’re probably right,” he agreed.</p>
<p>“I should go back to my room.”</p>
<p>“No, you should stay,” he said, sleepily.</p>
<p>“Why,” she teased, “are you falling in love with me?”</p>
<p>“No, it’s just, Ian’ll probably come back soon. If you really wanna make him jealous, won’t it be better for him to <em>see</em> us together instead of just hearing about it?”</p>
<p>“That’s a good point.”</p>
<p>She relaxed against him, savoring the heat of his body. She didn’t want to admit it, but at the moment she didn’t particularly care about Ian.</p>
