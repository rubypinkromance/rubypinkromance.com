  <div class="publication__content short__content">
    <p>Stacy heaved a sigh, pushed back from the dining room table, and stretched. Strewn around her laptop were assorted reference books, sticky notes, and printouts with colorful highlights. She’d spent the last several minutes repeatedly reading the same sentence, unable to make any sense of it. It was ten o’clock, and time to admit she wouldn’t make any more useful progress on her senior project tonight.</p>
<p>Moving to the living room, she settled on the sofa, pulled up her favorite movie, and tried to switch off her brain. She’d seen it so many times she didn’t need to pay attention. It was just a comforting distraction as she wrapped a warm blanket around her legs and fooled around on her phone. She was finally starting to relax when her stepbrother Hudson vaulted onto the other side of the sofa, nearly spilling his oversized bowl of cereal.</p>
<p>“Whatcha watching?” he asked through a mouthful of food.</p>
<p>“A rom-com,” she answered curtly, annoyed by his intrusion.</p>
<p>“Cool. Mind if I sit here? Your stuff’s all over the table.”</p>
<p>“Suit yourself,” she said, biting back a reply about how she didn’t have anywhere else to work. She wasn’t really mad at <em>him</em>. After all, it wasn’t his fault that his dad married her mom last year. Or that when they moved in, she’d had to give up her bedroom for him. She grudgingly admitted it made sense for her and her sister Flora to share a room, since they spent alternate weeks at their dad’s house. Even so, the loss of personal space was aggravating.</p>
<p>“What’s this about, then?”</p>
<p>“Those two,” she said, gesturing at the main characters, “hate each other, but they’re pretending to be in love to make his ex jealous and stop her parents trying to set her up with someone.”</p>
<p>“Oh yeah,” he nodded, taking another bite. “Sounds like it’s based on the Shakespeare play we just read in English class.”</p>
<p>“I guess.” Stacy rolled her eyes. Her biggest problem with Hudson was that he was boring. The most middle-of-the-road boy she’d ever met. Perfectly average in every way. His tastes were predictably mainstream. No hobbies to speak of. No girlfriend. He didn’t drink or party. Even his friends were boring.</p>
<p>Thankfully, he stopped asking questions, so she was able to mostly ignore him. He finished his cereal, but seemed interested enough in the movie to stick around.</p>
<p>After a while, she found herself getting drowsy. She slouched lower until her head was resting on the back of the couch. The familiar movie lulled her overworked brain into a state of relaxation. She pulled the blanket higher as her eyes drifted shut.</p>
<p>When she opened them again, the movie had ended, and it was past midnight. She blinked slowly, trying to figure out what woke her up. The house was quiet, but she could hear something out of place. A quiet noise she didn’t quite recognize. Blearily, she looked to her side. Hudson was still there, staring at his phone.</p>
<p>There was something different about his posture, though. He wasn’t scrolling idly through social media or playing a game. Sitting almost unnaturally still, his attention was entirely focused on the screen. She couldn’t make it out, but there was a lot of movement, and the sound was…</p>
<p>Oh! Holy shit. Was he really watching porn here in the living room? On the couch next to her?</p>
<p>Now fully awake, she felt a rush of conflicting emotions. Astonishment. Annoyance. Frustration. Embarrassment. Concern. But all of those were quickly drowned out by one overwhelming reaction.</p>
<p>Curiosity.</p>
<p>Without a doubt, this was the most interesting thing Hudson had ever done. Outrageous, sure, but she had so many questions! Why didn’t he just go to his room? Did he watch porn out here all the time, or was this a spur of the moment thing? She supposed she should be upset, but he didn’t seem to be paying any attention to her, and hadn’t done anything overtly creepy. It was almost like he just got distracted and forgot she was there.</p>
<p>And what kind of porn was he watching? She strained her ears for any clues, but could only make out the vague sound of a woman performatively moaning. That ruled out gay porn, she supposed, a little disappointed.</p>
<p>As slowly as possible, she shifted in his direction, trying to catch a glimpse. Focused on the screen, he didn’t notice her creeping closer, inch by inch, until at last, she could see.</p>
<p>The camera framed a young woman on her back, grabbing her knees. The man holding the camera was urgently fucking her. With each thrust, her tits bounced and she cried out. Suddenly, the man groaned and pulled out, spraying cum all over her body.</p>
<p>Hudson closed the video and scrolled through a list of others. She tried not to laugh when she saw he was browsing the stepsister category. It made sense, she supposed. Almost overnight, he’d gone from being an only child to living with two hot girls he wasn’t related to. Who wouldn’t be curious?</p>
<p>He picked a new video, and she couldn’t help but notice the girl had glasses and dark hair like her. Of course, the previous girl was blonde with fake tits, so that might not mean anything. She watched, along with him, as the “step-siblings” wrestled over the TV remote until the guy’s cock slipped implausibly out of his shorts and into her pussy. They pretended to be shocked for about three seconds, then proceeded to fuck.</p>
<p>The whole thing was predictable, except for the framing device that they were meant to be related. She knew it was fake, but even so, she was surprised to find herself getting into it. The hook was enough to keep the encounter excitingly scandalous. She imagined they were fucking like they were afraid of getting caught.</p>
<p>Hudson was enjoying it too, judging by the erection tenting his pants. She bit her lip as she watched him slowly rub himself. This was wrong. Sure, he’d crossed the line first by playing porn in front of her, but was she really going to let him keep going while she pretended to be asleep? What if he actually pulled it out? Some part of her wanted to let him, but she knew there was only one way to handle this.</p>
<p>“Oh my god,” she blurted, leaning closer. “What are you doing?”</p>
<p>“What?” He startled, almost dropping his phone as he tried to close the video. “Nothing!”</p>
<p>“Don’t lie,” she laughed, snatching it from his hands and holding it out of reach. “You’re watching porn!” On-screen, the girl who looked like her moaned as the guy rolled her onto her back and started thrusting between her thighs.</p>
<p>“Give it back!” He awkwardly tried to grab his phone without touching her, clearly hoping she wouldn’t notice his hard-on.</p>
<p>“Let’s see what else you’ve been watching,” she grinned, holding him off with one hand and scrolling with the other. “Oh, look, stepsister videos!”</p>
<p>“No, that’s not…” He risked getting a bit closer, pushing her arm out of the way and leaning over to reach for the phone. “Stop that!”</p>
<p>“Stepsister and brother have fun while parents aren’t at home,” she read, scanning the titles. “Fucking my stepsister after she teases me. Sharing a bed and cumming in stepsister. Ooh, here’s a good one, stepsister fucks stepbrother to borrow his car!” She laughed, still swatting his hands away. “Is this what you like?”</p>
<p>He lunged forward, knocking them both over. She squealed as she fell onto her back, and he landed heavily on top. Triumphantly, he wrestled his phone from her grasp.</p>
<p>“Um, what’s your plan, Hudson?” She grinned up at him.</p>
<p>“Huh?” It took him a moment to realize the position they’d landed in.</p>
<p>“Gonna act out your fantasy?” She squirmed under his weight, feeling his stiff cock pressing into her leggings.</p>
<p>“Shut up,” he retorted, and tried to pull away, but she wrapped her legs around his to hold him in place.</p>
<p>“Good point, we’ll have to be quiet,” she teased, rolling her hips. “Wouldn’t want anyone to hear you <em>fucking</em> your <em>stepsister</em>.”</p>
<p>“Knock it off!” Blushing furiously, he broke free and stormed out of the room.</p>
<p>“Wait, come back, I want to borrow your car!” she called after him, laughing.</p>
<hr>
<p>She was still laughing and heckling him the next morning as he made coffee before school.</p>
<p>“So, like, is it <em>only</em> stepsisters that do it for you, or do you watch other stuff, too? How do you feel about babysitters? Or nurses?”</p>
<p>He glowered, but did not reply as he shook the grounds into the compost.</p>
<p>“Why are you being so mean to him about this?” Flora asked as she walked into the kitchen.</p>
<p>“Are you kidding?” Stacy crowed. “This is the most interesting thing about him by far! A stepsister fetish when he has two stepsisters? Come on!”</p>
<p>“You told Flora?” he groaned.</p>
<p>“Oh, <em>immediately</em>,” she laughed. “This was too juicy not to share.”</p>
<p>“You’re not gonna tell my dad, are you?” He looked horrified.</p>
<p>“Not after the way he overreacted to Flora that time,” she frowned. “He’d probably blame me for this, and pack me off to a convent.”</p>
<p>Flora nodded, Hudson breathed a sigh of relief, and Stacy pounced on him again.</p>
<p>“What about threesomes? Everyone likes threesomes, right? What do you prefer, two guys or two girls? Does everyone in the threesome need to be a step-sibling?”</p>
<p>He gritted his teeth and rinsed the coffee strainer in the sink.</p>
<p>“Give him a break,” Flora scowled over a piece of toast. “Everyone watches porn. It’s not a big deal.”</p>
<p>“But I have so many questions! Like, what about boobs? Do you like big ones like Flora’s, or little ones like mine?”</p>
<p>His only response was to grip the edge of the sink in frustration.</p>
<p>“You don’t wanna answer in front of Flora, huh?” She grinned. “Smart. You can tell me later. No need to hurt her feelings. Let’s talk pubes. Do you prefer shaved or…”</p>
<p>Hudson turned and doused her with cold water from the sink sprayer. She sputtered in shock and disbelief. Wiping the water from her eyes, she saw his expression change. The anger drained away as his eyes widened in surprise. Following his gaze downward, she realized the water had soaked her top, turning it nearly transparent. Clapping her hands over her chest, she ran from the room.</p>
<p>As she fled, she heard Flora say “Don’t worry about it, she was being a total bitch.”</p>
<hr>
<p>Stacy spent the entire day thinking about how to get back at Hudson. That night, she waited until she heard him getting ready to take a shower. When he stepped out of his room with a towel draped over his shoulder, she followed him down the hall to the bathroom. Just before he could close the door, she blocked it and slipped in after him.</p>
<p>“What are you doing?” he asked, backing away as she closed the door behind her.</p>
<p>“We need to talk,” she replied cryptically.</p>
<p>“So you followed me into the bathroom?”</p>
<p>“Privately.”</p>
<p>“Whatever.” He scowled and draped his towel over the shower rod. “You’re just here to give me more shit.”</p>
<p>“I’m not,” she said quietly. “In fact, I want to apologize.”</p>
<p>“You do?” he regarded her warily.</p>
<p>“Yeah, Flora was right. I shouldn’t have teased you. I just thought it was funny! I’m sorry, I didn’t realize how upset you were until you turned the sprayer on me.”</p>
<p>“Right.” He rubbed his neck awkwardly. “I’m sorry, too. I didn’t mean to get your shirt wet like that.”</p>
<p>“Alright.” She leaned against the door, looking pointedly at him, and letting the moment stretch uncomfortably.</p>
<p>“And, um, I’m also sorry about watching porn on the couch by you.”</p>
<p>“That was super weird, dude.”</p>
<p>“I know, I’m sorry! I thought you were asleep. The girl in the movie was pretty hot, and when it ended I was a little turned on, and I kinda forgot you were there. I swear, I wasn’t trying to be a creep or anything.”</p>
<p>“I figured,” she shrugged. “You’ve never done anything sketchy before. I guess that’s why I was more curious than upset.”</p>
<p>“So, is that all you wanted to talk about? Because I was gonna take a shower.”</p>
<p>“No, um, there was something else.” She fidgeted with her shirt. “In the kitchen, you were kinda staring at me…”</p>
<p>“I’m sorry! I just got surprised…”</p>
<p>“And also last night on the couch, when you were on top of me? I could feel you had a hard-on.”</p>
<p>“I swear that was…”</p>
<p>“Do you have a crush on me?”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“Well, you’re into stepsister porn. You got hard watching a girl who looks like me. And then you were staring at my boobs. You can’t blame me for wondering.”</p>
<p>“No, no, no! Fuck no, I swear!”</p>
<p>She scowled at his overreaction.</p>
<p>“I didn’t mean it that way,” he grimaced. “Like, you’re attractive and stuff. And yeah, I got turned on, but I promise, I’m not obsessed with you or anything.”</p>
<p>“So, you <em>do</em> think I’m hot, but you’re not <em>into</em> me?”</p>
<p>“Um, yes?” He was clearly unsure if that was the correct response.</p>
<p>“Okay.” She considered for a moment. “Then show me your cock.”</p>
<p>“What? How does that follow?”</p>
<p>“It’s only fair,” she shrugged. “You basically got to see me topless. This makes us even.”</p>
<p>“No it doesn’t! Me kinda seeing your nipples through a wet shirt and you wanting to look at my dick aren’t the same thing at all!”</p>
<p>“Whatever! You watched porn next to me while I was asleep. You owe me.”</p>
<p>“Okay, okay.” He frowned. “Did you follow me in here just to see my junk?”</p>
<p>“Pretty much.” She bit her thumb. “Plus, if I’m being honest, after it poked me, I got a bit curious about what you’re packing.”</p>
<p>“Fine. But you have to promise not to tell anyone. Not even Flora!”</p>
<p>“Cross my heart.”</p>
<p>With obvious reluctance, he peeled off his shirt and dropped it on the floor. She grinned with anticipation. He sighed, and stepped out of his joggers. Now fully nude, he stood before her, giving her a good look.</p>
<p>“There. You’ve seen it. Happy?”</p>
<p>“Okay, now get it hard.”</p>
<p>“What? That wasn’t the deal. You just said you wanted to see it!”</p>
<p>“Well, <em>obviously</em>, I meant hard.” She rolled her eyes. “Who wants to see a limp dick?”</p>
<p>“No way!”</p>
<p>“What’s the big deal?” she shrugged. “I already felt it once.”</p>
<p>“That was an accident!”</p>
<p>“Again,” she said pointedly, “you <em>owe</em> me.”</p>
<p>“It’s not that simple,” he complained, even as he wrapped his hand around it. “I don’t know if I can do it with you here!”</p>
<p>“You didn’t have any problems last night.”</p>
<p>“That’s different! You weren’t watching!”</p>
<p>“Well, I’m definitely watching this time,” she winked.</p>
<p>He grimaced, closed his eyes, and started squeezing and pulling. She stared, fascinated by the way he manipulated it. However, after a few minutes, he remained stubbornly soft.</p>
<p>“This isn’t working,” he sighed. “I’m too self-conscious with you here.”</p>
<p>“Hmm,” she considered. “Would it help if I took my top off?”</p>
<p>“What?” He blinked in shock.</p>
<p>“Well, you seemed to enjoy getting a peek at my nipples this morning. Would it help you get hard if I let you see them again?”</p>
<p>“I mean, yeah. That would help.” He hesitated. “Are you sure?”</p>
<p>She shrugged, pulled her shirt over her head, and removed her bra. He stared as she stood topless before him. She cupped her breasts, gently squeezing them together. Unconsciously, he started pulling on his cock again, which quickly began to swell.</p>
<p>“Oh, look at him grow,” she giggled. “I’d ask if you like my boobs, but it’s pretty obvious you do.”</p>
<p>“Yeah,” he mumbled, “They’re, uh, they’re…” He trailed off as she pulled on her nipples.</p>
<p>“They’re sensitive,” she breathed, as they puckered and tightened from the stimulation.</p>
<p>“I can see that.” There was naked hunger in his eyes. If she’d had any doubt that he was secretly into her, it was gone now. She had him exactly where she wanted. Anything she asked, he would do now.</p>
<p>“Keep going,” she purred. “I want you to get as hard as you were last night.”</p>
<p>He groaned, taking longer strokes as his cock continued to grow. The head was protruding now, swollen and eager-looking. It twitched and strained, as if trying to get closer to her.</p>
<p>“Just like that,” she encouraged.</p>
<p>Hudson gasped in surprise as she lowered to her knees in front of him.</p>
<p>“Settle down,” she murmured. “I just want to see it better.”</p>
<p>She had to admit, Hudson had a pretty nice package. It looked like it would fit nicely in her hand… Or elsewhere. She bit her lip and squeezed her legs together as she considered how aroused he was by her.</p>
<p>“You’re so hard now,” she said approvingly. “Just from seeing me?”</p>
<p>“Yes, er, no?” he stammered. “I mean, any guy would get turned on in this situation!”</p>
<p>“Come on, bro,” she grinned. “Just admit you have a stepsister fetish!”</p>
<p>“I don’t,” he protested weakly.</p>
<p>“You really do,” she assured him.</p>
<p>A drop of precum appeared on the tip. His cock was pointing directly at her face. He pumped faster.</p>
<p>“It turns you on to see me down here, doesn’t it?” Heart pounding, she licked her lips and looked up at him. “To see your stepsister so close to your cock?”</p>
<p>“Uh,” he hesitated.</p>
<p>“Why can’t you just admit it? You can barely control yourself with me here.”</p>
<p>“No, I’m just doing what you…”</p>
<p>“What would you do if I said I wanted to see you cum?”</p>
<p>It was hard to say who was more surprised by that question, her or him. She hadn’t intended to go this far. But now that she was here, she wanted him to admit it so badly. If she just went a bit further, she could <em>make</em> him say it.</p>
<p>“Stacy, I…”</p>
<p>“What if I wanted to help?” She leaned closer, until her lips were nearly touching him.</p>
<p>“Ah!” His cock throbbed excitedly.</p>
<p>Oh, no. This was a bad idea. This was <em>such</em> a bad idea. What was she doing? Was she really considering this? She had to stop. How could she salvage the situation?</p>
<p>“Uh, you wish!” She laughed a little too loudly and gave his balls a flick.</p>
<p>“Ow!” He covered himself and sputtered in confusion. “What the fuck?”</p>
<p>“Did you really think I was gonna give you head?” She scoffed as she quickly pulled her shirt back on. No time for the bra. She reached for the doorknob.</p>
<p>“But you… I… Fuck!”</p>
<p>“I told you, I just wanted to see it. Now we’re even.” She blew him a kiss and slipped out the door, leaving him holding his dick in frustration.</p>
<p>In the hall, she shook her head, trying to clear the haze of arousal. What the fuck was that?</p>
<hr>
<p>The next day, he avoided her, which suited Stacy fine. She was still struggling to figure out her own feelings, and didn’t need to deal with his at the same time. But that evening, he sat down next to her on the couch again.</p>
<p>“What do you want?” She crossed her arms and scowled at him.</p>
<p>“I, uh,” he hesitated, thrown off by her hostility. “I just figured we should talk.”</p>
<p>“What’s there to talk about?” She gestured dismissively. “I told you, we’re even.”</p>
<p>“Stacy, come on. That wasn’t just you getting even, admit it.”</p>
<p>“It got a little out of hand,” she conceded. “But it’s your own fault for getting so turned on.”</p>
<p>“My fault!” He lowered his voice and checked to make sure no one was around. “You deliberately got me that turned on!”</p>
<p>“All I told you to do was get it hard.”</p>
<p>“You took your shirt off!”</p>
<p>“Only to get you over your little performance issue.”</p>
<p>“You got on your knees and kept egging me on!”</p>
<p>“Hey, I’m not the one with the stepsister fetish.”</p>
<p>“Why are you lying?” He hissed. “I saw it in your eyes. You were just as turned on as I was.”</p>
<p>“I was just playing a part,” she sniffed.</p>
<p>“Then why did you run away?”</p>
<p>“Is that what this is about?” she asked mockingly. “You’re mad I didn’t stick around longer? Beg you to cum all over my tits? Help you act out your fantasies about me?”</p>
<p>“Argh!” He clenched his fists in frustration. “Why are you being like this? What did I do to piss you off?”</p>
<p>“What did you do?” she snapped. “That’s the whole problem! You didn’t <em>do</em> anything.” It all came rushing out of her. “You’re so boring! Just when I thought I’d finally found something interesting about you, you’re too chicken to even talk about it. And then, you sprayed me down like <em>I</em> was the weird one! So, yeah, I decided to get even.”</p>
<p>“By teasing me? By leading me on? By accusing me of having a fetish?”</p>
<p>“Yes! Because you <em>do</em>!”</p>
<p>“I don’t!”</p>
<p>“You do! And you’re too afraid to admit what you want.”</p>
<p>“And you think that’s you?”</p>
<p>“Oh, I <em>know</em> it’s me. I saw the way you looked at me last night. If I hadn’t left, you totally would have let me seduce you.”</p>
<p>“I don’t understand! You sound like you’re mad nothing happened, but you’re the one that left.”</p>
<p>“Because you weren’t going to <em>do</em> anything unless I <em>told</em> you to do it. You can’t even admit you have a stepsister fetish!”</p>
<p>“I don’t have a fetish, I’m just into <em>you</em>!”</p>
<p>She glared at him. He glared back.</p>
<p>“You said you weren’t,” she hissed.</p>
<p>“I didn’t want to make it weird.”</p>
<p>“Too late.”</p>
<p>“So, you want me to, what,” he whispered, “admit that you turn me on?”</p>
<p>“For a start,” she dared.</p>
<p>“Fine, you turn me on.”</p>
<p>“Ugh, you’re such a pushover.” She rolled her eyes. “You’re basically letting me bully you into admitting it.”</p>
<p>“What, do you want me to push you down and <em>show</em> you?”</p>
<p>“Well, at least that wouldn’t be boring!” she snapped.</p>
<p>“Fine!” He grabbed her knees and pulled her sideways until she fell onto her back. In one quick movement, he got between her legs, settling his weight against her. Braced on his elbows, he stared defiantly into her eyes. “Feel that?” He pressed his pelvis against her, and once again, she felt his erection pressing through her leggings.</p>
<p>“Did you just get hard in the middle of a fight?”</p>
<p>“This has been really confusing!”</p>
<p>For a long moment, they stayed like that, staring into each other’s eyes while his cock throbbed against her. She felt flushed. Her heart pounded with excitement.</p>
<p>“What now?” she whispered.</p>
<p>“I was gonna ask you,” he admitted.</p>
<p>“Fuck’s sake,” she groaned. “You’re hopeless. Even now, you can’t say what you want?”</p>
<p>“Okay, fine.” He swallowed nervously. “You were right. I do want you to go down on me.”</p>
<p>“Say more.”</p>
<p>“I can’t stop thinking about it.” He continued with more enthusiasm when she nodded encouragingly. “About how your tongue would feel on my cock. Last night, I was so close. After you left, when I finished, I imagined cumming in your mouth.”</p>
<p>“That’s hot,” she breathed, rolling her hips. He twitched, and she felt an answering flutter inside. “Sit up and pull down your pants.”</p>
<p>“What, right here?” He sat up, glancing nervously over his shoulder toward the dark hallway. “Someone could come in!”</p>
<p>“They won’t,” she whispered, rolling onto her hands and knees. “Our parents are asleep, and Flora’s light is off.”</p>
<p>“Oh my god,” he breathed, pushing his pants down far enough to let his cock spring free.</p>
<p>Stacy eagerly wrapped her lips around his tip and swirled her tongue. He was almost as hard as last night. She wrapped her hands around his shaft and started stroking. The low groans he made as she bobbed her head sent a thrill down her spine.</p>
<p>“I can’t believe this is happening,” he whispered. “Fuck, your mouth is so hot.”</p>
<p>She moaned happily as he throbbed on her tongue. Already, he was lifting his hips, trying to go deeper. She pushed down on his stomach, wanting him to sit still and let her control the pace. In response, he put his hand on her head and encouraged her to go faster. Normally, she hated that, but it excited her to feel him asserting himself.</p>
<p>In fact, it was so exciting, she almost got them caught. She’d found her rhythm, and was working to take him into her throat. She was almost there when a door opened in the hallway behind them. He tapped her head and frantically scrambled to pull his pants up. She didn’t want to stop, and swallowed him deeper. He groaned quietly at the sensation, until finally, he grabbed her hair and pulled her off his cock.</p>
<p>She sat up, wiping her chin, just as Flora walked in to find them sitting in the dark. She paused on her way to the kitchen, and peered suspiciously.</p>
<p>“What are you guys doing?”</p>
<p>“Nothing,” blurted Hudson.</p>
<p>“We were just talking things over,” Stacy answered calmly.</p>
<p>“In the dark?” Flora asked.</p>
<p>“We’ve been talking for a while, and didn’t notice how dark it got.”</p>
<p>Flora shrugged and walked into the kitchen.</p>
<p>“Go to your room,” Stacy whispered to Hudson, “and stay hard for me. I’ll join you soon.”</p>
<p>He nodded eagerly, and shuffled awkwardly down the hall to his room.</p>
<p>A few minutes later, Flora came in with a glass of water and sat beside her on the couch.</p>
<p>“Is everything alright?” she asked.</p>
<p>“Yeah, we’re good,” Stacy reassured her.</p>
<p>“Cool. I don’t like when you two are fighting. It makes me feel like I have to pick a side.”</p>
<p>“I know. It’s okay, we apologized, and worked it out.”</p>
<p>“Good. You wanna talk about it?”</p>
<p>“Thanks, but I’m all talked out.”</p>
<p>“Okay. I’m heading to bed. Love you.”</p>
<p>“Love you, too. I’m gonna stay up for a while.”</p>
<p>They hugged, and Flora walked away.</p>
<p>Stacy forced herself to count to 100, then calmly walked down the hall to Hudson’s room.</p>
<p>His light was off. She opened the door without knocking, and quickly slipped inside. Hudson was sitting on his bed, eyes wide with nervous anticipation.</p>
<p>“I told you to stay hard for me,” she whispered.</p>
<p>“I did,” he murmured, reaching into his pants.</p>
<p>“Good,” she smiled. “Then get undressed, so I can finish what I started.”</p>
<p>“We have to be quiet,” he said as he stripped, carelessly tossing his clothes in the corner.</p>
<p>“I know,” she grinned, pulling off her top. “This used to be my room, remember? I know how thin the walls are.”</p>
<p>“Right, right.” He rubbed himself as she shimmied out of her leggings.</p>
<p>“God, you’re so sexy,” he breathed as she walked slowly toward him, savoring the way his eyes explored her nude body.</p>
<p>“Lie down,” she purred, giving him a gentle push. He shuffled backwards onto the bed, settling with his head on the pillow.</p>
<p>She followed, crawling up to kneel at his side. His cock twitched eagerly against his stomach. She lowered herself, and let him feel her breath on his skin. He shivered as she licked up the length of his shaft. It strained upward, rising to meet her, and she wrapped her lips around his head.</p>
<p>“Oh fuck,” he groaned as she swirled her tongue around him. “Stacy, that feels so fucking good.”</p>
<p>Wasting no time, she resumed bobbing her head, letting him slip deeper each time. He throbbed in her mouth, and she felt her body answer in kind. This was why she’d run away last night. On some level, she’d known that if she actually wrapped her lips around him, she wouldn’t be able to stop. And then she would have had to confront the fact that she wanted him, too.</p>
<p>He shifted sideways on the bed, reaching out to run a hand up the back of her thigh. His touch sent a shiver of sensation up her spine. She pushed down until she felt resistance when he hit the back of her mouth. He moaned again, and it was all the encouragement she needed. With another swallow, she took him deeper.</p>
<p>He stifled a cry of pleasure as he slipped into her throat. His cock pulsed, and his thighs strained as she struggled to hold him there without choking. His hand squeezed her shoulder, and he lifted his hips, wanting more. She slapped his thigh as she pulled back, gasping for breath, then did it again.</p>
<p>She couldn’t believe this was happening! It was shocking, how much she turned him on, and how much that turned her on. Her insides clenched excitedly as she let Hudson experience his fantasy. How many times had he dreamed about her lips on his cock?</p>
<p>“Fuck!” He groaned quietly, straining upward. Her eyes watered, and she swallowed repeatedly, until at last her lips reached his root. She could feel his pulse against her tongue as he throbbed in the heat of her mouth. “Fuuuck,” he said again.</p>
<p><em>Be quiet</em>, she thought. <em>If you keep making so much noise, Flora will hear us!</em> Her heart pounded in her chest. The idea that someone would catch them was terrifyingly exciting.</p>
<p>At last, it was too much, and she pulled back, sputtering and trying not to gag. His cock throbbed in her grasp, and she eagerly continued licking, flicking her tongue against the tip.</p>
<p>He shifted again, and she jumped as his hand reached up between her thighs to caress her lips. His touch felt delicious.</p>
<p>“Oh wow, you’re so wet,” he whispered, excitedly slipping a finger inside. She gasped in surprise, then wrapped her lips more tightly around him. He pushed deeper, then pulled out, eagerly fingering her in time with her stimulation of his cock.</p>
<p>It was distractingly good. She bobbed her head as he added another finger, curling inside to reach a spot that made her moan. She spread her legs wider, pushing against his hand and rolling her hips to meet him, even as he started breathing heavily and thrusting upward.</p>
<p>“Stacy,” he breathed. “I’m gonna cum…”</p>
<p>She moaned encouragingly and sucked harder. His fingers thrust into her dripping pussy, matching the rhythm of his cock in her mouth. She felt almost delirious, head swimming in pleasure. He was going to cum for her! She wanted it. Needed it.</p>
<p>“Ah!” He grunted, moving his hand from her shoulder to the back of her head, pushing her down as he lifted up. His fingers stopped moving, even as his cock started pulsing and twitching. She swallowed eagerly as he pumped his cum into her mouth. After the first few spurts, he relaxed his grip, and she eased back until just the tip was between her lips, milking the last of his climax.</p>
<p>Finally, he shuddered, and she let him slip out. His taste filled her mouth, potent evidence of how much she aroused him. She swallowed the last of it, feeling a wave of satisfaction roll down her spine until she squeezed around his fingers, still nestled inside.</p>
<p>“Oh my god,” he gasped. “That was…”</p>
<p>“Yeah, it was,” she purred, still gently squeezing the base of his cock. It felt so natural in her hand that it took her a moment to realize he wasn’t getting softer. “Hey, you’re still hard,” she purred happily.</p>
<p>“Yeah,” he moaned, “That happens sometimes, when it’s been a while.”</p>
<p>“You can go again?” she asked eagerly, stroking him with more enthusiasm.</p>
<p>“Yes,” he gasped, straining in her hand, “but be careful, it’s sensitive. I won’t last long.”</p>
<p>“I won’t either,” she grinned, getting up. His fingers slipped out, and he looked up at her in surprise as she moved to straddle him.</p>
<p>“Wait, are you sure?”</p>
<p>“I just let you cum in my mouth,” she grinned, “and <em>now</em> you’re asking if I’m sure?”</p>
<p>“I just mean—ah!” He gasped as she rubbed his head between her lips. “Like, a blowjob is one thing, but…”</p>
<p>“Don’t you want to feel your stepsister’s <em>tight</em> little pussy wrapped around your cock?” she teased, slowly lowering herself.</p>
<p>“Oh fuck,” he groaned, squeezing her thighs. “I mean, yes, but shut up about the stepsister thing.”</p>
<p>“Maybe once—ah!—it stops being so funny.”</p>
<p>“Look how—ohhh—wet you are! Looks like I’m not the only one with a step-sibling fetish.”</p>
<p>“Stop talking,” she purred, finally taking him all the way.</p>
<p>He moaned happily as she started rocking in place, grinding her pelvis against him. She leaned forward, bracing her hands on his shoulders, and gasping at the pressure it put on her clit. He reached up and took her breasts in his hands, trapping her nipples between his fingers. Little sparks of electricity danced through her system, and she felt the pressure growing rapidly.</p>
<p>“You feel so good inside me,” she moaned.</p>
<p>He groaned, his entire body rigid beneath her.</p>
<p>“Don’t cum yet,” she purred. “I’m close.”</p>
<p>She rolled her hips, leaning into his hands and savoring the way he felt. Little waves of pleasure radiated from her core. She dug her fingernails into his shoulders, rocking in place, letting the sensation build and build…</p>
<p>“Stacy,” he warned.</p>
<p>“Not yet,” she hissed. Her insides clenched around his cock. His hard shaft throbbed, resisting any efforts to pull him deeper or push him out. She squeezed her thighs around his waist, struggling not to cry out. Her clit thrummed, the pressure growing, ready to explode.</p>
<p>“I can’t,” he groaned.</p>
<p>“Please,” she begged.</p>
<p>“Ahh!” He suddenly released her breasts, letting her collapse on top of him, and pulled her into an intense kiss. His cock throbbed and twitched, warmth spreading as he came inside her. She moaned around his tongue as his climax triggered hers.</p>
<p>He held her close as she shook uncontrollably around him. She could feel him everywhere. Her lips met his eagerly. He thrust desperately up into her, sending shockwaves of pleasure through her body. It was all she could do to cling to him as they came together.</p>
<p>At last, she found herself gasping for breath, with her head resting on his shoulder. He shuddered as his cock softened and slipped out. She giggled and rolled onto her back, pushing a hand between her thighs to catch his cum. Her body was relaxed and humming with satisfaction.</p>
<p>“Stacy, that was…” He stared at her breathlessly. “That was…”</p>
<p>“Pretty fucking great?”</p>
<p>“Yeah.” He looked worried. “I’m sorry I couldn’t hold off any longer. I tried to warn you…”</p>
<p>“I know, I just wanted you to wait so I could cum, too.”</p>
<p>“So, it’s okay?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, I came,” she grinned. “You couldn’t tell?”</p>
<p>“No, I mean, yeah, I just… um…”</p>
<p>“Oh, you’re worried about cumming in me?” she laughed. “Relax, I’m on the pill.”</p>
<p>“Good,” he breathed a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>“So, what now?”</p>
<p>“You’re asking me?”</p>
<p>“You had a stepsister fantasy, and you got to make it real. Did you get it all out of your system? Are you gonna be able to control yourself around me now?”</p>
<p>“Um,” he hesitated, weighing his answer carefully. “Yeah.”</p>
<p>“Hmm.” She poked his chest playfully. “Too bad.”</p>
<p>“What? What are you saying?”</p>
<p>“Oh, nothing,” she smiled. “I’m gonna go clean myself up and go back to my bed.”</p>
<p>He watched, speechless, as she got dressed. Before opening the door, she paused and looked back at him.</p>
<p>“Let me know if you change your mind.”</p>
<p>She blew him a kiss and slipped out.</p>
