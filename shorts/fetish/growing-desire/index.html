      <em>Mary is surprised to learn her best friend has a pregnancy fetish.</em>
    </p>
  </header>

  <div class="publication__content short__content">
    <p>Mary watched enviously as the characters in the rom-com finally fell into bed together. She hadn’t had sex for three months. Normally, she’d just find a guy on a hookup app, meet him for coffee to be sure he wasn’t a creep, and bring him home. But ever since her pregnancy started showing, guys had developed an alarming reluctance to touch her. They would say hi, notice her belly, get nervous, and make an excuse to leave.</p>
<p>The worst was when they gave her a little respectful nod on the way out. Respectful! She wasn’t looking for <em>respectful</em>, she was looking to get <em>fucked</em>. But it seemed like nobody was down to hook up with a pregnant chick.</p>
<p>Which was doubly frustrating, because she’d never been hornier in her life. Her girlfriends had told her about the “magical” second trimester hormones and the incredible sex they’d had with their partners. Of course, none of them had been single at the time.</p>
<p>Her ass looked great, her tits had never been bigger, and she was juicy <em>all</em> the time. Her body wanted action, and no matter how many times she used her vibrator, it wasn’t the same.</p>
<p>She sighed and squirmed on the couch as the woman in the movie moaned passionately. Lucky bitch. Annoyed, she turned off the TV. At the same moment, Adam’s door opened, and he walked past her to the kitchen.</p>
<p>That was her other problem. Adam was her oldest and closest friend. Years ago, they’d dated briefly, and managed to stay on good terms afterward. Now, they split the rent on an apartment downtown. They hung out constantly, and shared everything. He didn’t even mind when she brought guys home. It was the most stable relationship in her life.</p>
<p>Or it had been, until she got pregnant. At first, he was super supportive. He’d stay up late with her, talking about what her baby would be like, and even came along for her first ultrasound. But over time, he grew distant, until they barely spoke. They saw each other only in passing, or when he emerged from his room to get food. Whenever she made eye contact with him, he got a weird expression on his face and left quickly.</p>
<p>She scowled as he rummaged in the fridge, ignoring her. The worst part was, he didn’t even seem upset. She could understand if they’d had a fight, and he wasn’t talking to her because of that. But to have him avoid her for no clear reason hurt worse than anything.</p>
<p>Enough.</p>
<p>She could handle having the baby on her own. She could even deal with the frustrating lack of guys who wanted to fuck her. But to have her best friend ghost her like this was intolerable. She stomped into the kitchen, glowering as he closed the fridge door.</p>
<p>“Adam,” she said curtly.</p>
<p>“Hey, Mary.” His eyes flicked down to her belly before glancing away. “I’ll be out of your way in a second.”</p>
<p>“Stop doing that!” she snapped.</p>
<p>“Doing what?”</p>
<p>“That thing where you turn away, like you’re ashamed to see me.”</p>
<p>“I’m not,” he stammered nervously, “I just, uh—”</p>
<p>“Look at me!”</p>
<p>Wincing, he slowly raised his head. She noticed him avoid looking at her body.</p>
<p>“What is going on with you, man? I thought you were on board with me having this baby!”</p>
<p>“Huh?” He looked genuinely confused.</p>
<p>“The bigger I get, the more you dodge me! Is it a religious thing? Did you suddenly get weirdly conservative?” She realized with annoyance that her eyes were brimming with tears. She didn’t want to cry, she wanted to be angry. “What is your problem? This is a rotten time for you to suddenly develop an issue with single moms.”</p>
<p>“What? Is that what you think?” He grimaced. “Oh fuck, Mary, that’s not it, I promise.”</p>
<p>“Then what?”</p>
<p>“I, um, I kinda realized… I mean, I guess… Oh boy. I might be sorta…” He scratched his head and trailed off awkwardly.</p>
<p>“Well, spit it out!”</p>
<p>“I think I’m into pregnant women.”</p>
<p>“What?” Mary blinked in surprise. “Into? Like, <em>into</em>, into?”</p>
<p>“Yeah,” he shrugged. “I’m as surprised as you are.”</p>
<p>“So, you’ve been avoiding me because…”</p>
<p>“Because you turn me on,” he confessed, cheeks flushing red.</p>
<p>“But we broke up ages ago! We’ve been friends forever. Hell, we’ve lived together for two years now, and you’ve never acted this weird around me before.”</p>
<p>“Well,” he shrugged, “you weren’t pregnant then.”</p>
<p>“Seriously? Is this a new thing?”</p>
<p>“I guess? I’ve never really spent any time around other pregnant women, so it hasn’t come up.”</p>
<p>Mary frowned, considering this revelation. It did explain a lot. He’d never seemed upset or judgmental, he just tried not to look at her and left as quickly as he could.</p>
<p>“Wait,” she said, putting two and two together. “All those times you ran away to your room, were you jerking off to me?”</p>
<p>“No!” He protested, turning red in the face. “I leave because it’s so awkward to think of you like that.”</p>
<p>“Think of me like what?” she teased. “Sexually? You’ve seen me naked. I’ve gone down on you. We’ve had sex! I know it’s been years, but I know this isn’t the first time you’ve thought of me like that.”</p>
<p>“No, I mean, it’s different now. Not like, objectifying, it’s like you’re, I dunno, more feminine? Not feminine, I mean,” he gestured at her body, struggling for words. “Like, <em>womanly</em>. Stop laughing! I don’t know how to explain.”</p>
<p>“No, no, I’m laughing because I get it. My body can’t stop reminding me what’s happening. Everything’s dialed up to eleven. And it’s not just the bigger boobs.”</p>
<p>His eyes flicked to her chest, and he shifted his weight awkwardly as she continued.</p>
<p>“I cry at baby commercials. My hormones are in overdrive. I have the <em>wildest</em> dreams…” She trailed off, shivering at the memory of waking up that morning, moaning into her pillow, from a dream of a guy thrusting forcefully into her from behind.</p>
<p>Meeting his eyes, she hesitated for a moment before adding, “And everything’s… engorged.”</p>
<p>“En—engorged?” He seemed unsure how to react to the rapid shift in her mood. Moments ago, she’d been on the verge of tears, then laughing, and now she was biting her lip and looking at him like a cat stalking a bird.</p>
<p>“Yeah. My breasts are tender. My nipples are sensitive.” She caressed them, surprised to find herself reveling in his desire. “They want to be <em>touched</em>.”</p>
<p>“Getting ready for the baby, I guess?” He cleared his throat awkwardly.</p>
<p>“I have to be careful,” she said, taking a step towards him. “Sometimes, I’ll be in public, and they’ll start leaking. If I don’t wear pads, I’ll soak through my shirt.”</p>
<p>He couldn’t resist looking directly at her chest this time. She squeezed her breasts together, encouraging him.</p>
<p>“Does it excite you to think about my breast milk?” She moved closer. “Are you curious what it tastes like?”</p>
<p>“What?” He startled as he backed up against the counter. “I, uh, I dunno.”</p>
<p>“Also?” she continued, licking her lips, “I’m <em>always</em> wet.”</p>
<p>“You mean, from the breast milk?” His eyes were wide with surprise, unable to believe what was happening.</p>
<p>“I mean my <em>pussy</em>.”</p>
<p>“Oh fuck,” he breathed.</p>
<p>“I get turned on so easy now,” she purred, leaning up against him. “I haven’t been fucked in forever, but my body’s primed for action. I’m ready. Like, right <em>now</em>.”</p>
<p>“Now?”</p>
<p>“Yes,” she moaned, squeezing her legs together. “I’m soaking.”</p>
<p>“Ah!” He yelped as she reached down to feel his erection through his shorts.</p>
<p>“You’re ready, too, aren’t you?”</p>
<p>“No, no, no,” he protested. “That’s involuntary. I couldn’t help it! You’re talking about all this stuff, and I just got hard, I swear, I’m not—”</p>
<p>“Adam, why are you holding back?” She pleaded, pushing her tits against his chest and rubbing his shaft. “You told me you’re into me, and I <em>need</em> to get fucked.”</p>
<p>“Oh god!” He squeezed his eyes shut, trying to restrain himself. “I don’t want to take advantage of you.”</p>
<p>“But I <em>want</em> you to take advantage of me.”</p>
<p>He groaned, cock throbbing in her grasp. “Our friendship—”</p>
<p>“—will be in trouble,” she said, pulling down his shorts, “if you don’t let me suck your cock, and take you to the bedroom to fuck me until I scream.”</p>
<p>“Fuck,” he gasped, as she dropped to her knees, eagerly taking him in her mouth. “Oh fuck, yes!”</p>
<p>She moaned happily as his cock throbbed on her tongue. Swirling around the ridge of his head, she pulled him in. He was already swollen thick, and barely fit in her mouth, but she was determined to take him as deep as possible.</p>
<p>Gazing up at his shocked expression, her eyes crinkled with satisfaction. He groaned as she bobbed her head, until he filled her mouth completely, then pulled back, releasing him and gasping for breath. He gripped the hem of his shirt tightly, clearly not sure what to do with his hands. Smiling, she took one, placed it on top of her head, and wrapped her lips around him again.</p>
<p>He took the hint, and started applying gentle pressure, encouraging her as she tried to take him deeper with each bob of her head. She moaned and reached behind to grab his ass, squeezing tightly. Still, he hesitated, touching her lightly, and barely moving his hips.</p>
<p>“Stop being so gentle with me,” she growled, pulling back just long enough to say it before swallowing him again. She put her hand on top of his, indicating he should hold her head firmly in place, while grabbing his ass and pulling him forward.</p>
<p>“Oh fuck,” he moaned, and started thrusting more earnestly into her mouth. She moaned wordless encouragement. His head was bumping against the back of her mouth until she angled her head back. With a gasp of surprise, on his next thrust, he pushed into her throat.</p>
<p>She gagged, pushed him back, gasped for breath, then pulled him in again. This time, he didn’t hesitate, wrapping his hand around the back of her head and thrusting eagerly into her hungry mouth.</p>
<p>A warm glow of pleasure started radiating from her core. She missed this. Having a guy want her. Need her. Use her. Not tip-toeing around, respectfully refusing to fuck her. Adam was excited by the changes to her body. His desire swelled against her tongue, throbbed in her throat, desperate for the heat of her body. She took him as deep as she could, holding him there until her eyes watered.</p>
<p>“Oh fuck,” she choked, pulling back and gasping for breath. He moaned as she wrapped a fist around his sloppy wet shaft and continued to stroke him. His cock was thick and hard as steel. She couldn’t wait any longer. “Come on,” she said, struggling to her feet.</p>
<p>He trailed after her in a daze, watching as she stripped carelessly, a trail of discarded clothing left behind on the way to her bedroom. Without looking back, she climbed onto her bed on her hands and knees.</p>
<p>He positioned himself behind her, rubbing the head of his cock against her entrance. She shivered as he slowly entered her, her lips spreading wide around him.</p>
<p>“Your pussy is so hot!” he moaned, caressing her back.</p>
<p>“Fuck me,” she breathed.</p>
<p>Cautiously, he started moving his hips, gently sliding out and easing back in. She moaned, feeling every inch of his shaft, and needing more.</p>
<p>“Harder,” she begged, rocking back against him.</p>
<p>He tightened his grip on her hips and started moving more confidently. Her sensitive nipples dragged against the sheets, already leaking from the stimulation. Her insides squeezed desperately around him.</p>
<p>“God damn it, <em>harder</em>!” she demanded.</p>
<p>Groaning loudly, he started fucking her forcefully. With each thrust, a wet slap echoed off the walls. Her pussy squelched wetly around him. She felt the pressure building, but she still needed more.</p>
<p>“Pull my hair!” she grunted.</p>
<p>Adam grabbed a fistful of her hair, and for once, didn’t hesitate. He pulled hard, forcing her up off her elbows as he fucked her. He tugged with each thrust, jerking her head back as his cock filled her. Finally! Her body crackled with electricity as the pressure mounted.</p>
<p>“Ah! Yes!” She screamed as a wave of pleasure crashed over her. Every grunt he made echoed in her core, clenching repeatedly around his throbbing cock. She groaned and panted, bucking back against him, sobbing with release as he gave her what she desperately needed.</p>
<p>When her barks of pleasure subsided, he let go of her hair, and allowed her to collapse, gasping, onto the sheet. He continued to slowly fuck her, which sent delicious aftershocks rippling through her.</p>
<p>“Mary,” he asked quietly, “will you get on top of me? I want to see your belly and your tits.” He seemed worried, as if now that she’d cum, she’d suddenly find his pregnancy fetish outrageous. He didn’t need to worry. His request sent a fresh surge of arousal through her system.</p>
<p>She pulled forward, shuddering as he slipped out. He clambered onto the bed, lying on his back. She bit her lip at the sight of his cock twitching against his stomach excitedly. She could see her cream glistening around the base, evidence of how ready her body was for this.</p>
<p>Eagerly, if a bit awkwardly, she swung her leg over, positioning him between her lips. They made eye contact, and she savored the little gasp he let out as she lowered herself slowly, until her full weight was resting on his pelvis, and his cock was buried fully inside her once more.</p>
<p>He stared up with awe in his eyes as she caressed her body for him, rubbing her hands over her belly and up her sides to cup her breasts. Her dark nipples were swollen large, and as she massaged them, thin milky liquid dripped over her fingers. She felt his cock throb inside her at the sight.</p>
<p>“You like the way my tits look?” She continued to gently squeeze them. “See how much they’re leaking?” He nodded eagerly. “You did that,” she purred. “I’m so turned on right now. Do you want a taste?”</p>
<p>“Oh god, yes!” He squirmed, trying to thrust up into her as she brought her wet fingers to his lips. Shamelessly, he licked them clean, tongue working between each finger to get every drop. He moaned with satisfaction.</p>
<p>“Can I…” He trailed off, eyes locked on her still-dripping nipples. He licked his lips, hesitating to finish his question, unsure if he was about to cross a line.</p>
<p>“Say it,” she encouraged him, rolling her hips to grind her clit against his pelvis.</p>
<p>“Can I suck on your nipples?”</p>
<p>Before he had even finished the question, she was leaning forward, bracing herself on the headboard. Her belly pressed against his, and her breasts hung over his face. She gasped as he lifted his head to wrap his lips around her nipple, pulling it into his mouth. His tongue swirled eagerly over her sensitive skin, and she felt a warm sensation of release.</p>
<p>He moaned happily, face pressed into her swollen breast as she started rocking on top of him. His cock thrust unyieldingly into her juicy pussy, the pressure stimulating the parts of her body that were still hungry for more.</p>
<p>She rested her head against her forearm, gasping and groaning as she rolled her hips. He moaned into her soft flesh, and she felt his fingers digging into her thighs. He released her nipple with a wet sound and switched to the other breast. She gasped again at the sensation, feeling her insides begin to ripple around his shaft.</p>
<p>His muscles tensed, legs straining as he squirmed under her, gasping for breath around her tits. His cock throbbed urgently as he thrust up into her. She cried out as he shivered, sucking harder, eagerly lapping up the sweet liquid.</p>
<p>“Oh fuck,” he gasped, releasing her nipple with a wet pop. “I’m gonna cum! Where do you want me to cum?” He stared up from between her breasts, desperately trying to hold back until she answered him.</p>
<p>“Inside,” she moaned happily. “Do it inside me!”</p>
<p>She rolled her hips one last time, trying to take him even deeper. He groaned loudly as his cock started twitching. She shivered as her insides clenched in response, sending thrilling waves of sensation radiating outward. Eyes squeezed shut, he grimaced and moaned, throbbing over and over.</p>
<p>“Oh, that’s it,” she purred. “Give it to me. Cum for me, Adam.”</p>
<p>“Mary,” he sighed into her cleavage.</p>
<p>Only when she felt him begin to soften and slip out did she roll off him. Lying on her side, she giggled as she felt his warm cum leaking out.</p>
<p>Adam gasped for breath and gazed at her with awe in his eyes. She smiled back, glowing with satisfaction.</p>
<p>Then, she reached out and flicked his nose.</p>
<p>“Ow!” He winced, rubbing his face. “What was that for?”</p>
<p>“Dummy,” she laughed. “We could have been doing this the whole time!”</p>
<p>“Sorry,” he grinned with relief. “I guess I should have told you sooner.”</p>
<p>“You’ll make it up to me,” she winked.</p>
